I respect that decision but I don't agree with it. I am a student athlete here attending your school and even though i have an A average i have friends who have C averages and are wonderful athletes. Yes The policy is agreeable and it has benefits to make students get better grades. Yes it is going to make students try harder in the classroom. There also a down fall to that decision. If the policy gets changed will the work get easier? There's got to be a reason most students have a C average and i believe its because the work is to hard. Sports are a very important roll in me and my friends life's. It keeps us out of trouble in and out of the classroom. sometimes When our work is too hard or if we just don't feel like doing it we start to slack. Now since we have sports we actually do our work. C averages are a pretty good grade. I know we can do better sometimes but what if the work is way too hard and we try our best and get help on all of our subjects. Then we still make the same grades. Its probably one of the two reasons. The work is too hard or the teacher is not teaching the correct way. I think that the decision that has been made to change the grade average is fair. Some people like the change, preferring parents mostly and then some people do not like it at all, preferring the students. Then there is some students who think that the decision is a fair deal because it will keep there grades up.

A student can look up science experiments to do as their projects that could be entrusting for the class or for them selves to. Also they can talk about a famous\\xa0person or about someone in their family and explain why they wrote about that person. Students can invent new projects and show off to the class and explain how they came up with it and what will their invention help them or others. Students could have more fun creating their own projects. Students will be more exited to be able to do create their own projects then follow a boring one a teacher assigned everyone.

       " \"Paraphrase the following text upto same length: Dear TEACHER_NAME, It has come to the attention of the student body that you are considering two possible plans of action to deal with the evident cell phone problem. I will go ahead and start by telling you that taking away cell phones all together will only cause misery and sorrow for all. It is my suggestion and that of the school that you would allow us to have our phones available for use in our free time and lunch periods. Of course they would be turned off in class as they should. There are so many reasons that we use phones as much as we do and taking them away will cause a tension like no other. The good outweighs the bad in this situation for many reasons and I am prepared to prove that. The bottom line and one of the main reasons we should have our phones available for use is the connection. Kids need to be connected and be able to interact with each other. It is simply part of being a growing person. We need that constant interaction to settle our nerves and keep us up on our friends lives. Obviously the class room is not the appropriate place or time for that. However, kids texting and talking in their own free time is completely acceptable. Connection is important to kids. Take it away and all is lost for us all. There is a big question that goes through a teens mind every time they are told to put there phone away. That question is what is 'What's the point of having a phone if I can't use it?' While it may seem immature and childish it is a legitimate question. Is there really a point of having a phone if you are constantly told to put it up and keep it off. Do you think that a kid or teen texting in the hall is going to bring the world to a stop. Ask yourself for you may have a cell phone to 'what's the point?' As the day goes by and the homework piles up stress is immense to say the least. One of the great things about cell phones is that they are great at relieving stress. At some points of the day it seems like your world is going to explode. A funny text from a friend is a sure fire way to cheer up your day. Stress cushions and massages can claim to calm you down but the best way to cool your nerves and get a grip is by sitting down and talking to a friend over the phone. Take some of the It may be one of the worst mistakes made by adults, thinking that taking away cell phones will solve all of their problems. It will only make kids made ,who will in turn make adults and teachers alike, miserable. If you haven't found out already, cell phones are actually for the benefit of all, even in a school environment. It will make life for teachers a breeze and likewise for kids. For all of these reasons and so many more I would ask you with the sincerity of my heart that you will please consider letting us use our cell phones in school. sincerely, STUDENT_NAME\",\n",
       " \"Paraphrase the following text upto same length: Community Service Dear principle, I think all students should be required to do some community service. I think this because its a good thing to do. Helping elementary school kids with lets say math can really help them in school. Maybe their parents didn't have a good education and they cant help them. That's where community service comes in, your helping a kid who needs help. Another example is helping out the elderly people, like carrying their grocery bags or helping them clean up their back yards. Helping the elderly can help them. Maybe their too weak to carry their own bags and they need help. A lot of elderly people now a days are dying because their trying to do chores they can't really do but they have to do because no one is their to help them do them. Cleaning up trash is also a good thing to do because your helping make our world a cleaner place. Think about all the sea life that's died because they got tangles up in a trash bag and suffocated because people are too lazy to put their trash bags into their trash bags. If you clean up trash your saving and animals life and that's a good thing to do. Another reason why I think community service should be required is because it looks good on college applications. When you apply for a college their going to first consider a person who has had community service hour then someone who has no community service hours. They would consider a person with community service hour over someone who has no community service hour because that shows that they actually care about what's going on with the world. Doing community service can also help you make some friends outside of your school. Also doing community service can help you as a person. It can help you learn about how its a good thing to do and also spend some of your day outside in the fresh air. If one day your stuck at home and need something to do you should go outside and do some community service it makes your day less boring and you get to get out of your house for a little while and do something good.\",\n",
       " \"Paraphrase the following text upto same length: Dear Principal, I wish to address you on how you are considering making community service a requirement for students. First off I'd like to express my feelings on community service then I would like to go on to talk about whether making it required would be a good idea or not. Community service is a great opportunity to help others. It not only helps and brings happiness to others but in ways you'll find that doing community service can help you too. Many people do it so willingly because of the good feelings they get from knowing that they're making a difference and benefiting someone else without them having someone to pay them to do it. It also helps people greater understand charity and service to others of which the feelings you get from doing these things come no other way. In the end most people feel accomplished and they are sometimes helped just as much as the people they were helping. They volunteer most of the time not for money but for reasons like what i just talked about. Though great experiences and feelings can come from doing community service bad ones can too. When forced to do something a persons natural reaction is to strike out against or oppose it. The students might start to feel this way such as convicts who are assigned community service by the state do. If this happens the service will be done poorly with little effort and the feelings that are supposed to come from it will be pushed away. In this way of service and in your plan to force the students into it they might skip it even and more importantly they wont learn any lessons or feel any emotions but annoyance. So if you can't force them to do it then how can you get them to do community service? Encouragement is the answer. By helping and asking politely and advertising community service there will be a far better chance that students will do it, but more importantly they will want to do it. Get the students excited about it and they'll do it and be able to freely experience the great blessings community service has to offer for both sides. Yes you will have a lot less people that end up doing it, but the people that do will be excited, motivated and ready to make a difference in the world one community at a time. Sincerely a student that cares\",\n",
       " 'Paraphrase the following text upto same length: Dear Principal, Most people feel good when they help other people, and they do it as often as they can. They might be a volunteer at a soup kitchen, donate money, pick up litter, help someone put up their groceries, or any other community service. Volunteering is a great way to help the community and anyone can do it, however volunteering is called volunteering for a reason. When you volunteer, you\\'re willing to give up your time to help someone else. You shouldn\\'t force someone to volunteer for community service. Volunteering is a choice. That\\'s why it\\'s called \"volunteer.\" Some people might want to help out, but they don\\'t have time. They could have a job after school, plus have to do all of the homework required by your teachers. If you force students to perform a service, they might not be able to reach there highest point academically because they\\'re so bogged down with a to-do list. Students would get too stressed out with everything they have to do. Stress isn\\'t good physically or mentally, and that could cause grades to go down. Not having to do community service would give students more time for studying and other things like an after-school sport or club. If you want more kids to participate in extra-curricular things, you can\\'t add another burden onto their shoulders. You know what they say, All work and no play... Helping out the community is very important, but community service isn\\'t the only way for a person to help out in the community. Most people recycle, or donate old clothes to a local charity. A recent survey showed that starting a recycling or donating program at our school would have a lot more willing participants than required community service would. In fact, 90% of the student population said they would love to help out with my proposed programs, whereas only 40% would be willing to volunteer for a service. Donating and recycling, or another idea you may have that\\'s easy do to and doesn\\'t take too much time, would be just as helpful to the community as volunteer work would be. People who have the time for volunteering can and will do it on their own. I would encourage students to take part in community service, but sometimes, people just don\\'t have the ability to. There is no need for you to require community service in our school. Don\\'t force students to be a volunteer, because then it just wouldn\\'t be volunteering. They wouldn\\'t be as willing to do the service, and they might not do the job as well as they would if they did it by choice, and the community service would be a waste of time if the helper didn\\'t do it right or well enough. That\\'s just common sense. Please consider my suggestions, and thank you for taking the time to read my letter. Your Student, STUDENT_NAME      ',\n",
       " \"Paraphrase the following text upto same length: Education has been taught through traditional classroom settings for centuries. The moment that school bell rings to signal the start of the school day, students prepare for their day of learning. Without that important aspect of education, students can slack off. With video conferencing, the students are in a place they consider to be relaxing. The attempt to learn through a video conference at home would not be time spent well by the students. Most people wouldn't take the situation seriously and proceed to fool around. Students would not benefit from online conferencing at home because of the ambiance of the school that provides students with an environment meant for learning, the social interactions that are created with fellow peers, and the idea that the method can be taken advantage of. School is a location where students spend roughly six hours learning and an hour for walking to class and lunch time in Generic_City. The environment contributes greatly to the likelihood that students want to learn while they are at school. Especially since technology has advanced so much in the last couple of decades, teachers can teach students in many unique ways. That face-to-face interaction with the teacher can help students learn in depth\\xa0rather than staring at a computer screen. People value experiences where they were taught something magnificent and the feeling that resulted while sitting in that classroom. That feeling will never be able to replicate from a student starting at a computer. There was this moment in class when I really thought that this teacher had a great ability to teach and cared how her students were absorbing the information and not just memorizing for an exam. My science teacher in seventh grade spent time making foldables, activities, and experiments that were not only interesting, but related to the topic that we were learning. She taught us a lesson every class that could be used when we enter the reality of life after college. One time we were learning about the history of DNA. She spoke of how a female scientist died not knowing that her discovery in science became historic in the development of other topics. She noticed the connection that people were mistreated and advised us all to be aware that in the real world, ideas are stolen, but we should advocate for the truth. Every student in Generic_City has heard of a PBL (Project Based Learning). Administrators of public schools have implemented these assignments that require the effort of multiple people working together to come up with an amazing result. If the Board of Education cares so deeply about the benefits of students working together, so should we. With the online conferencing method of learning, students wouldn't have that interaction that is so crucial to work in the real world. During these PBLs, students learn to compromise, share ideas, and work through disagreements. These experiences come in handy when at work someone is placed in a group that they don't know and is expected to work together to find a solution for a problem. Recently, the Corona Virus (COVID-19) has become one of the most deadly diseases historically. Scientists, from all over the world, have banded together in an attempt to find something that would help slow down the transmission of the disease or even a working cure. The message of teamwork and collaboration is an idea that has been stressed for decades. For example, during WWII, the atomic bomb was in the midst of its creation. The Allies (U.S., Britain, France, etc.) sent over their scientists to the U.S. to work on the Manhattan project; a project that's goal was the creation of an atomic bomb. Collaboration in the educational environment can't be substituted by a video on a computer screen. Anything that requires technology can be manipulated. The idea of online conferencing could be done, but the actual use of it wouldn't accomplish anything. In order of getting out of school (online conferencing), students could think of a million reasons why they weren't there for their online conferencing. This could include losing their computer, not having internet, being busy for some reason, and etc. It's complicated enough that some students can leave during the school day, but this online conferencing would give students even more leeway to get out of their education. People agree that in some circumstances, students can't physically be able to attend school. Whether there was an accident or a student was sick and contagious for weeks, maybe online conferencing would benefit them. In the past, before online conferencing was suggested, schools have already dealt with this issue. Usually, students will get their work ahead of time or periodically and then when they are able to return to school, they catch up with the teacher's assistance. In the end, that person should recover nicely. Once my friend was sick on and off for three weeks. She was taking four college level classes and three advanced classes. When she was at home, she took the initiative to tell all her teachers and get the work. Sometimes, I would call her and ask if she needed me to explain anything. The traditional way to learn is perfectly fine for students. All situations can be resolved to help a student that's facing hardships. Some college students have mentioned that nine out of ten times, high school was an experience they wouldn't trade for anything else, even with the bad times. Those memories of attending school events like pep rallies, homecoming, prom, game nights and more wouldn't have even happened without traditional education. The connections that are forged including friendships and romance. All of those are created because education was made to be a creative environment where students learn and are happily doing so. The benefits of a traditional learning environment clearly outweigh learning through a computer screen.\\xa0\",\n",

While there have been efforts in the past who decades to make cities denser and better for walking, planners are now taking the concept to the suburbs. Many experts expect public transport serving suburbs to play a much larger role in a new six year federal transportation bill to be approved this year. All of our development since World War ll has been centered on the car and that will have to change. As a result, 70 percent of Vauban's families do not own cars and 57 percent sold a car to move here. Paris enforced a partial driving ban to clear the air of global city, Diesel fuel was blamed, since France has a tax policy that favors diesel over gasoline. Dieseles make up 67 percent of vehicles in France, compared to a 53.3 percent average of diesel engines in the rest of Western Europe, according to Reuters. Parks and sports centers also have bloomed throughout the city, uneven, pitten sidewalks, rush hour restrictions have dramatically cut traffic, and new restaurants and upscale shopping districts have cropped up. President Obama's ambitious goals to curb the United States' greenhouse gas emissions, unveiled last week, will get a fortuitous assist from incipient shift in America behavior. Recent studies suggest that Americans are buying fewer cars, driving less and getting fewer licenses as each year goes by. The sociology professor at Drexel University and director of its Mobilities Research and Policy Center said that differents things are converging which suggest that we are witnessing a long term cultural shift. Demographic shifts in the driving population suggest that the trend may accelerate. There has been a large drop in the porcentage of 16 to 39 year olds getting a license, while older people are likely to retain their licenses as they age. In conclution it has beneficial implications for carbon emissions and the environment since transportation is the second largeest source of America's emissions, just behind power plants. It also has negative implications for the car industry but America's love affair with its vehicles seems to be cooling, the number of miles driven in the United States peaked in 2005 and dropped steadily thereafter, according to an analysis.       \\xa0    \",\n",
       " \"Paraphrase the following text upto same length: I dont think that FACS should be able to be used in classrooms to read students emotions. Students should be able to have the abilty to feel what they want not be told how they feel. If we have FACS in the classrooms then the kids are going to be told what they feel and not learn what they are feeling on there own. If a student is sad but doesn't want everyone to know becase they dont want to talk about it then Facs would not give that student the space they need. FACS is reading your emotions before you know what your emotions are. Its telling you that you will be sad before you know that you will be sad. Or if someone says something mean to you and you dont know how to feel about it FACS tells you to feel happy or sad or mad. If you want privace then FACS takes it away by reading your face. it reads it and knows your mood. it can tell when you are mad at someone or sad about something. You cant get away from your emotions so FACS will always reed them. In conclusin i dont thin FACS should not be able to be used in classrooms because it invades peoples privace and it tells student how they are feeling before they know.

Also you cold become part of a family they could take you in and youk cold have another really close friend from some were far far away from were you live. In the story Luke said\"It would a chance of a life time.\" An I think it would be a chance of a life time. In my opinone I would do it. I would love to go on a trip tio eventure around the world. I love learning new cultres and to see what what it could help me with in my life. Also that it would be cool to do a report on all the places that you whent to in the proses. If I were him or any one els that got the opertunity I would say yes to doing it. In my family its important to learn and get youst to doing thatbecause my famoly dose alot of edventering. We go to the D.R, Hawaii Colorado, and alot more places too. I think that any kid that gets invited should that, because what they learn stiks to them and it stays with them for a long time and if they dont then they missed a big opertoonity to do that. I went to the DR for the first time when is like 5 years old and I learnd a lot of spanish when i as there. I also made a lot new friend people my age people that older younger than me too. An we bonded rely whell and i didnt know how to speek a word of spanish!!!

And the hole time I was there I was so happy till it came to the part when I had to say by to all my new good friend that I made there. Its hard to leave but then you get to all the other places and meet other people there too. People that want to explor should do this in order to see what ist like and if thay want to do this for the a long time or not. Just one time at a different place then were you live is awesome because you never want to leave. You could also go see uther animal sthat you have never seen befor in a zoo or that you have never herd of too.

Well what if I said that there was a chance to go visit the planet Venus. Yes, there is many dangers on Venus, but there is so much to explore too; like how Venus is the most like Earth when it comes to shape and size, the gases and temperture, and the curious of how Venus looks like now. When you think of Venus, what do you think of? Do you think of the heat or the size? Well, when scienetist think of Venus they \"[often] referred to as Earth\\'s \"twin\", Venus is the cloese planet to Earth in terms of density and size, and occasionally the closet in distance too\". So, becasue of how close it looks in shape and size, you have to have though in your mind of, what else does it have in common. When you think of dangerous gases and temperture, what this the things that you think of? Do you think of hot summer day or the gases in the air? Well, on Venus \"[a] thick atmosphere of almost 97 percent carbon dioxide blankets Venus. Even more challenging are the clouds of highly corrosive sulfuris acid in Venus\\'s atmoshpere. In the planet\\'s surface, tempertures average over 800 degrees Fahrenheit, and the atmospheris pressure is 90 times greater than we experience on our own planet\". Eventhough, it could be life theathing, there are scientist that want to do test and collect gases and ect to do studies. They want to do studies because they want to learn some much more about Venus. When you think of how Venus looks like, do you think of craters and the sign of no life? Well, you be somewhat correct because it has a rocky surface, and it looks like valleys, mountain and craters. Although \"[long] ago, Venus was probably covered largely with oceans and could have supported various forms of life, just like Earth\". Since, there was a possible that there was life forms and etc, scientist want to see if there was some kind of life living up there, but then got exstinted or somethings else happened to them. So, to rap this all up, scientist know the danger of explore Venus, but sometime you have to do thing that are danger to learn new things. People alway talk about wanting to explore different planets, but they never do it. Yes, there are going to be opsolcules in the way, and there are going to be dangerous things we have do to go there, but it will be worth it in end. Nevertheless, there was forms of life on Venus in the past, why not have life on Venus again.       ',\n",

For example, Once in my science class we were all given the opportunity to choose our own summer project topic as a class while doing our own research and designing our presentations. During the creating process, everyone reached out to eachother and used their personal skills and strengths to help one another and come together as a team. When it got to the time where we had to present at the, everyone's hard work and research, along with personal skill, we were able to do a great job by taking leadership and teaching each other new things without a teacher involved. This shows that students can take leadership while working together without a teacher's ideas in the center of the project. Students designing their own projects gives them the chance to choose a specific topic within their interests which would improve their performance and increase the amount of effort that they give towards the project. For instance, while given the chance to choose my own topic during an individual project , I was able to focus more and put in more effort due to my motivation because I was able to do my project on the topic that I liked. This proves that when students are given the chance to do something that they like and that interests them , their performance and effort may improve because it is the topic of their choice. Some people say that teachers should design summer projects because they are more trustworthy and that students may just choose a topic that is easy and quick so that they can finish early. However, they are wrong because teachers may choose a topic that students are not interested in and that the students may not understand, leaving more work to the teachers because they students may need extra assistance and may lack motivation. For example, If a class is given a project on something they never learned in detail or showed interest in during class time and they have to research it over the summer, the class will not be motivated to put in much effort and will rely on the teacher for information, this will put more work on the teacher. Giving students the opportunity to design their own summer projects more frequently should be considered, to improve their motivation and effort and to help them learn teamwork from each other.   \\xa0   \\xa0 \\xa0\",\n",

They should be allowed to play a sport just the fact that it makes them become have confidence, have communication , and show off their skills. By playing sports kids become confident in what they do. It teaches them to never be shy and face your fear. They learn that when show a project to someone it is the same thing like playing your sport, the fact that people stare is not as bad as what it seems. It lets them have communication towards their teammates. By communicating it doesn't let them become shy around anybody. They learn that they should just say what is on their mind. They become more influent talkers and know what they need help on with speaking. They can show how great they are at something. They may be bad at something, but they know that they are good at something for sure. It shows that are ever talented at what they do and also that they put a lot of courage and effort.

Online classes help kids who like to work quickly on assignments\\xa0and students who need more time on things. Working at home allows you to wake up any time and get your work done. Also distance learning is beneficial for students who get sick. Although students who don't have access to WIFI at home may be a problem. Overall being able to work from home is more beneficial for students. First it is a fact that some students pick things up faster than others. Working at home would be good for both learners. The people who work faster can move quickly through assignments\\xa0and get their things done. While the people who work slower can take there time and not feel pressured by other students. That feeling when you are the last one working on a quiz is not a good feeling. It just makes you feel like you need to hurry up an finish because everyone is finished. You won't need to worry about that when you are at home by youeself working. Next waking up early in the morning and coming to school begins to get annoying. Some mornings you wake up with a lot of energy and are ready to go to school. And sometimes you just feel like laying in bed a little longer to get some more rest. With distance learning you can wake up at anytime and start your school work. And won't haft to worry about being late or missing the school bus. Finally distance learning is beneficial for students when they are sick and stay home. Some students stay home so that they don't get other people sick. If they stay home they still can get their work done online. A great example for this is the current virus that is going around coronavirus. Staying at home will lower the rates of this virus spreading which means you have a lower chance of getting it. Distance learning will help you stay healthy and stay on top of your school work. In conclusion distance learning\\xa0is a very effective way to learn. And it is beneficial\\xa0for students to be able\\xa0to take classes from home. Schools should offer distance learning to all of their students. And distance learning is an great idea for many diffrent reasons.   \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0   \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0\",\n",

Some individuals think you should be required to do it, but the others may think opposite. In my own opinion, I believe that you should have the option on whether or not to do community service. Helping people and the community is very important, but some people don't have the time to do so. Some people may have sports, while others may have all the time in the world. It would be great to encourage students to take part in it at least once a week, or maybe even once a month, but not everyday. Most children enjoy fun activities, and to some of the children this is not fun. If you require students to perform community service, there would be a lot of complaints. You might even have children not liking school or doing things they are not supposed to. I think we should encourage students that they can make their own decisions to prepare them for the future. Forcing them will not do any good. I do agree that community service is very good, and many people should take part in it, but some people just don't enjoy doing activities as such. Would you like being forced to take part in an activity you didn't like? I wouldn't. I hope you take my opinion to good concern. I presume that you would be happy with just making community service an option. I will be happy with whatever you choose, but just know that making it an option will develop good reactions.

The ability to simply call a taxi and have a driverless car pick you up and take you wherever you wish, whenever you wish will revolutionize the way people get around. The technology may be in its primitive stages as of now, but soon driverless cars can help to automate many tasks that are currently being done by humans. Driverless cars will be an excellent addition to the modern world. Not only does the driverless car make sense practically, it also has many safety benefits. If all cars on the road are driverless, they can communicate much better and have much less risk for accidents, unlike with human drivers who can only control the car so well. The automated cars will be directly linked to brake systems, so if there is a need to brake, the car is hydroplanning, or another emergency is occuring, the computer system onboard the car can easily and effectively stop the car from spinning out by applying specific amounts of brake to each tire, as explained in section 5 of the story. Another safety measure taken with driverless cars is the ability for a human to take over. Google's driverless car will notify its passengers if they need to take over the wheel, as explained in section 7 because the task on the road is too difficult for the car to perform. Assurance of the ability for a human to still control the car is very important, since even though the computer systems onboard the car may be very smart, humans have the ability to judge most situations better than any computer can. One counterargument to driverless cars is the loss of jobs. This is not stated in the article, but it would be an issue with driverless cars regardless. Many people working as taxi drivers, trash truck drivers, freight truck drivers, or any job involving driving can lose their jobs. This is a problem, especially in the US where there is already a shortage of jobs. Although driverless cars will bring many benefits, the cons of them have to be talked about as well. Driverless cars are a scary prospect. The thought of a car driving itself can make many people uneasy. If done correctly, however, driverless cars can revolutionize the way that many things today work. With companies such as Tesla, Mercedes-Benz, Audi and Nissan planning to have fully automated and driverless cars on the road and ready to go by 2020, driverless cars are just that much closer to becoming a reality. Driverless cars would make an excellent addition to the modern world.\",\n",

This Face was discivered 25 Years ago on a space Expedition. Most NASA scientisis believe that this Face on Mars is a natural land form but, some believe that it is not natural and was formed by Alians. Many Scientists also think against the thought of the formation on Mars being made by an ancient civilization that lived on Mars. Scientists that are against the theory of the face being formed by Alians argue that there are formations on Earth that are also formed how the one on Mars was and that this is natural. Many Scientisis believe that this is a natural landform because it is like some of the other landforms in the Western United States like the Butte in the Snake River Plain of Ohio. Scientists believe that both of these landforms were created by lava domes because the two formations are around the exact same height and are therefore believed to be created in the same and natural way. Scientisis have been researching the Face on Mars for years abd have come up with a reasonal explination for why the Face on Mars was not created by Alians and is a natural land formation that is created the same way as some formations in the Western United States.

This process has its pros and cons, but i\\'m more in the con side; you see the reason why the Electoral College needs to be abolished is because people dont really get to choose who their president is, the people who choose the president are the people in the Electoral College. How the Electoral College works is the state has electors and those electors have to be won by the president for the president to have how many electoral votes he gets from that state depending on how many electors that state has. The trick here is that sometimes the electors can deny the will of the people since the election is based on electoral votes not on popular votes, don\\'t get me wrong people\\'s votes do influence electors in deciding which president won their votes. Overall the electoral college is unfair to everyone because of the winner-take-all system in each state, candidates dont spend time in states that they have no chance winning over so they got to the \"swing\" states since they have more chance of winning them over depending on their campaing. I don\\'t think we should be trusting people to vote for us because as we have seen some electors vote for the candidate they want to win and not the candidate their state wants to win. Thats my rant about the Electoral College and I hope it makes you see clearer. Best Regards, Alberto        \\xa0    ',\n",

They would most likely forget what they had learned from the previous school year. Some schools have given the students projects to do during the summer but the projects are usually designed by teachers. However, it would be better if the projects were designed by the students themselves. When a student designs a summer project, it would give them more motivation to work on it. If people were to do things they wanted, it would make them more comfrontable and motivated to perform the task. Whenever there are summer assignments, they are usually made by teachers. Some students will still work on the project, but it would be more easier to do if the students were the ones who made the project. A student would usually prefer if they could design the summer assignment themself instead of the teacher. Having the students create the summer project can also be enjoyable for them. Usually when a person does something they want to do, it would usually be something of their interest. Students would less likely perform a task if it were something that did not interest them or that was disliked by the them. Having a school project designed by students would further make the students more motivated to design and complete the summer assignment since they would create it in a style they are interested in. Letting a student design their own summer project would also show what the student still remembers any knowledge from the school year and put it into the project. If students did not have much interests or lacked enough content to put into the project, they would most likely add content they had still remembered from the school year into the school project and this would help show if letting the students design the project was effective or not in terms of what they had still remembered from the school year. With all the ideas the students could have in designing a summer project, there are still some issues that can occur when a student designs the summer assignment. They could go off track with the project and not put in any academic related content into the project. There are also a few times where a student might actually lack ideas to add into the project which later might end up not having much of a project at all. However, this is why there are summer projects, it is to have students continue learning during the summer. Schools should still have the students design the project themselves. Students will most likely forget what they have learned if they were not given a summer project. But if they were given one and had to design it themselves, it would have many benefits such as: giving them more motivation, enjoying the project whenever they work on it, and showing what they have learned from the school year. That way, the students would overall continue learning through the summer while also enjoying themselves.',\n",

I tried what my friends said I couldn't do and I did it only because my family and close friends gave me good advice. So even if you can get great advice from one person try to get a group of advice to find out the best idea. if you wanted to rob a bank would you get one friend that says yeah sure or would you want fifty of your other friends saying no. That is an example of good advice taking asking many people for advice instead of one or two. you will have a higher chance of coming out better with more advice advice than one or two people. if some random kid said I bet you wont jump into the river and you ask all of your family and they say dont, who's advice would you take?\",\n",
       " 'Paraphrase the following text upto same length: Everyday, students across the world attend school. Whether it\\'s elementary, middle, or high school, millions of students obtain their education through learning. While many of these learners attend school in person, there are plenty of students who receive their education through online school. From video conferencing to special programs, these students do not physically attend school in-person. And with technology becoming more advanced and easier to use, many schools are beginning to offer these online learning services to their students, allowing them to learn from home. Students would not benefit from attending classes from home because they would get distracted, and they would not be engaged with their learning. One reason why students would not benefit from attending classes at home is distractions. While having the leisure of working from home, students would also have the convenience of the accessing internet. With pressing a few keys on a keyboard, a student can go from attending an online class to watching a movie on an entertainment service. Another distraction that could occur is distractions in the home of the student. A student could have younger siblings that often create noise and be loquacious, which could interfere with their education. Also, as a high school student myself, I can conclude that the most distracting item that I hold is my cell phone. Not only is it entertaining, it is also very convenient to use. With attending school from home, not only can students access their cellular devices, but they can also use them freely with no higher authority disciplining them. These distractions can be crucial on a student, as well as their education. Another reason why students would not benefit from attending classes at home is that they would not be engaged with their learning. Students could decided not participate in their online class, and there would be no one to hold them accountable. A higher authority is needed to keep students on track with their learning. Additionally, if students attended school from home, they wouldn\\'t have any fellow students to interact with. A teacher of mine once said, \"It is not only the education that you gain from attending school. It\\'s the connections that you make with friends, and the bonds that you build along the way.\" Without companions and friends to work with, students would not feel as compassionate about school. However, these connections are not limited to just fellow students; building connections with teachers is important as well. Teachers can provide advice to their students about schoolwork and life, which could help a student forever. While students would benefit from attending school in person, there are advantages to attending school online. Not only is it convenient for the students, but it is also convenient for the students\\' parents. Many public schools are controversial for parents, and it is understandable that they would rather have their child attend school from home. Online school would also be beneficial for students with transportation issues. Instead of walking to school or having to drive a far distance everyday, they could learn from home without any issues. However, online classes would not be easy for everyone. For students without financial support, they might not be able to attend school online, even if they wanted to. Laptops and computers are very expensive, and to buy them the student will need a copious amount of money. There are plenty of benefits of attending either online school, or school in person. Online school provides the student with the leisure of working from home, and attending school in-person creates bonds with friends and teachers. Students would not benefit from attending classes at home, because they would get distracted easily and not be engaged with their learning. As a high school student that has physically attended school for 11 years, I have built many friendships and connections with teachers and other students that has helped my life exponentially. If I had attended school online, I do not believe that I would be where I am today.\\xa0',\n",

Seeking multiple opinions can help someone make a better choice by giving them different views on things. Advice is the best way for children to learn how to make good choices and not let anything bad possibly happen. Some examples would be going through body changes such as puberty. When kids go through puberty, a lot happens and they might get stressed out. So family and close friends of theirs will be there to give advice or anything the children need. Some teenagers need help from family or close friends on getting advice after going through a breakup. Going through breakups isnt easy and loved ones will always be there to help him or her. Some kids like to get advice from a teacher on how to prepare well for a test coming up. They do not want to fail so they make sure the teacher gives them some sort of extra practice. Teenagers that are getting ready to become an adult should get advice from both parents on life skills that they should know for when they do become an adult, so they won't be as stressed out. More examples would be if you know someone that is possibly at risk or in danger and you don't know what to do, you should go to a trusted adult and talk to them, so they can help make sure nothing bad will happen to that person. People of all ages like get advice from anyone on what to wear, to make sure they are dressed appropriately for wherever they are going, and to make sure they look good. Teenagers that applied for an interview to get a job might want to ask both parents for advice on how to act, what to say, what to wear, and how to prepare themselves for that interview. Getting opinions from both parents will help provide enough information to do well. Even parents like to get advice from other parents for different point-of-views on new cooking recipes to try out, or better cooking techniques, or new cooking tools to use. Getting opinions on certain situations helps so much more than trying to figure\\xa0it out\\xa0yourself. Adults, family members, and close friends will always be there to give advice to you whenever you need it, and it's important to get advice so you don't make a bad choice or mess something up. Never be scared to ask anyone for advice because they will just want to help you\\xa0and not make you feel ashamed or worthless. Different people have different thoughts on situations and\\xa0each input will help a lot. From all of these examples, that's why seeking multiple opinions can help someone make a better choice.   \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0\",\n",

       " \"Paraphrase the following text upto same length: Do you think all students need to participate in extracurricular activities? Do you think that is fair to students who have other things they must complete? If you said Yes to these questions, then you would agree with the principle who thinks that all students needs to participate in some kind of extracurricular activity. But, I think students do not need to participate in extracurricular activities if they do not want to. First of all, Some students might have important things that they must complete. For example, Homework, Is something that all students deal with. Here is a scenario, say Generic_Name has a big science project on Newton's third law, he is almost done with it, it is due the next day, but he cannot finish it because he has to go to the student council meeting at 5:00 because his principle requires him to. What should he do? Another example is, Generic_Name is trying to finish his Geometry and Civics/Economics homework, which they are due tomorrow, but he has to go to the school basketball team practice this evening, and he cannot miss it. If students have to do these things, then they might not get things done on time. Do you still say yes to the two questions in the introduction? Another reason could be, a student, of all the choices available, might not want to do anything because nothing sounds good to them. Like if a student was looking for something to do, and they don't find anything, then they may have to do something they don't want to. Say Generic_Name is trying to find something that he would enjoy, he does not find anything that he wants to do. So the school assigns him something, Soccer, but he does not like soccer and does not have fun doing it. How about now? Do you still think all students need to do extracurricular activities? Have you ever considered the fact that some students might just want to stay home with their families? Or go somewhere on the weekends? Or just relax on the weekends? Well, if you still say yes to the two questions in the first paragraph/introduction, then consider the fact that some students come home after a long day at school, and they just want to relax, talk to their family about their day, or watch a movie, TV show, etc. Or on the weekends where they just want to stay home, visit their relatives/friends, or go somewhere, like museums, the store, or somewhere they will enjoy it. Here is another scenario, Generic_Name plays on the Baseball team, and there is a championship game coming up, he is very excited for it, and he cannot miss it unless he is sick. But Generic_Name and his family are going to the beach, something Generic_Name has been looking forward to, but the coach schedules the championship game the same day that his family is going to the beach. What should he do now? It's things like this that can interfere with family events that a student might look forward to. Now what do you think? After all the things I have just explained to you, do you still think extracurricular activities should still be required? OK, if you still say YES to the first question, you might think this. If you play a sport, wouldn't that be good exercise for you? Yes, but a student could get great exercise at their house, If they go outside, then they could ride a bike, scooter, skateboard, etc. They could also get great exercise at school to, P.E. they run, play games, sports, etc. going outside and doing PE is a great way to get some exercise. I think doing an extracurricular activity is something that students do not need to participate in if they do not want to. Do you STILL disagree with me after all that nonsense? I hope you do agree with me now. Anyway, extracurricular activities is something that the student should decide upon, not the principle. The student should be the one that decides that kind of thing. If we live in a free country, why should this even be an argument?\",\n",

This topic is often debated, many want to but cannot seem to overcome the atmoshperic conditions. The author of this article thinks it is worth exploring. The modern electronics wouldn't survive,it's tempurature is 800 degrees and NASA's sulotion has even greater diffficulties. The third paragraph in this article the author discusses the planets atmopshere and temperature. The atmosohere surronding Venus is 97 percent carbone dioxide,a gas deadly to humans. The clouds around Venus are very corrosive sulfuric acid, and the pressure is 90 times greater then on earth. The temperature at the surface is 800 degrees. These climates are far more extreme than any climate on eath. The author does not give a very good reason the danger are worth it in this peregraph. These dangers could very easily end a life of any person willing ot explor Venus. In paragraph four the author discusses how NASA wants to send people to study venus. They do not currently have any invintions that would allow humans to be on the sufrace of Venus. They are purposing a vehicle similar to a blimp that would travel 30 miles above the surface of Venus. The heat would still be a 170 degrees, but the pressure would be survivable. However in paragraph six the author continues to shut down ideas, that would prove their point. They talk about how the atmosphere is so dense that light would not be able to penetrate it. Then continues to talk about how they couldnt gather rock,gas or any other samples. They also state that standered photography and videagraphy would be useless. In paraghrap seven the author goes over the aproaches of tecnology. They say NASA is working on some electronics made of siclicon carbide,though they are simplified they lasted three weeks in a simulatution of Venuses atmosphere. They are also working on old technology. The devices were first thougt of in the 1800s and played a big part during world war two. The devices used levers and gears to make calculations. They do not work as quickly as modern computers but are less sensetive to extreme conditions. Over all the author of this article did a poor job supporting this idea. They made many claims, but the counter claims seemed to take more importance. In the last paragraph the author seems to support the idea better then in the rest of the article.\",\n",

I think student would not be benefit if they had distances learning. Many student would not focused during the lesson they would just do whatever they want so they won't learn as much as if they had a teacher. If student had online classes they would not get the attention necessary if they need help. Some student often have a bad day so they often don't pay attention and they just don't do the work that is assigned to them. they often just search the answer without learning but they think that's okay because no one is watching them. Many of them\\xa0don't learn the subject but still somehow they passed the class. Other Important, reason why student won't benefit from online classes is that the may have some big problem in their life and they need someone to talk to but their one home so they feel sad, but if they were in school they can talk to a teacher,coach,counselor, or any other they feel happy to talk too. Other student may be sad they don't have someone to talk too. Online classes don't benefit students because they don't have the help they need. When student take online they can paid someone to do their work, and pretend that they did the work. One reason they can ask their brother to the work for them so they are not really learning anything. Other example, student may request some extra help but they won't get it because they don't a teacher with them. so they just don't understand but when it comes to do the text they failed. Other example might be that they are having family problem so they won't do the online classes. And they would not be focus. Having online classes won't help student in their life. one example is that they won't have friends and when they go to the real world they are going to have trouble talking to people because they don't know how too. Other important reason why school should not have online classes is that many student need to talk to a counselor for that they want to be when they grow up. and most. Most counselor guide their student the right way they teach the career we want to have in our life. but they take online classes they don't have the opportunity to chat with them. When students get video conferencing they don't really understand because something the video don't really explain what the student want to learn. one reason is the student might feel lazy to replay the video so he does not understand. and if he was at school teacher would help them with all their work . School should not have video conferencing. Student are going to feel bad when they get older that they took online classes.. one reason they going to feel bad is that they did not enjoy high school life. let's Image if a student was really good at soccer or any other sport and if they had played high school they could of get a scholarship, and maybe become one of greatest, but they did'it because they were talking online classes. school should not have online classes because it take the right of student in playing high school sport. Overall, student would not benefit from online classes. they won't learn that much at home, and student need the attention to do work, they also need people to help them with their work. In my personal option school should not have online classes or video conferencing. Student are going to have a better knowledge if they go to school and, they work with teacher. School should let student enjoy take their high school life and not have online classes.\",\n",

If you're having a fight with your friend, multiple opinions will help because you can see the argument from their point and try to understand what they are feeling. Multiple opinions can also help you make a strong decision based on if you agree or disagree with what the opinions say. I was in a horrible argument with one of my friends. When we were fighting I searched for multiple opinions and it helped me make the right decision. After I talked to my mom and dad about what was happening they helped me realize that the girl was never a good friend to me and that I deserve a real friend. Different views help with more than just arguments; they can help with forming your own opinion too. Last year I took civics class and I didn't fully have an opinion formed on politics. I started watching the news and political debates and I formed my own opinions on current issues. If I had only watched one news program or only listened to one person's campaign then I wouldn't have known that there was a different way to see things and I would have never formed a good opinion. Whenever seeking advise you should always look for a variety opinions because someone could be wiser and already have lived through what you're going through. My mom has always been there for me whenever I need help and I hope that I can be there for her when she needs multiple opinions. She has always been very wise beyond her years and I love her for it because she helps me so much everyday. Talking about problems with many people will help you learn multiple views on the matter at hand.

People many times dont know who the right person to take advice from is, but there is more than one person that can assist you with what you need. When asking for advice, talking to multiple people is a good choice, because people have experienced things differently from one another. It also allows you to hear from both sides of the story so you can get a clear picture of what you should do. People experience\\xa0things in different ways, so getting advice from different people will give you a clearer picture of what you need to do. For example lets say somebody wanted to practice for the English writing SOL, lets call this student Generic_Name. To be prepared for the SOL, Generic_Name asked his friend for advice on what he should study the most. Since everybody struggles on different things, and also gets different prompts, Generic_Name wouldn't have practiced as efficiently as he could have. Now if he had asked multiple people, including other students in his English class, and his English teacher he would have been more prepared to study, and ready to take the test. This is why when asking for advice you should take in consideration\\xa0multiple people's opinions, so you have a better idea of what you need to do. When you are stuck making a difficult choice that is subjective, or you just do not know the whole story, getting advice from multiple sources can help you make a more educated choice. Take Generic_Name Jr. for example, his friends just had a fight and he dosn't\\xa0know how he should react because he was not there when the fight broke out. To know whose side he should take, Generic_Name Jr. asked another student that had seen what had happened to help him. The problem is, that the student that he asked to help him figure out what had happened, already disliked one of the kids that was involved in the argument, and was biased. Because of this Generic_Name Jr. made the wrong decision. If he had asked other witnesses, or even the actual kids that had participated in the argument, Generic_Name would have made a smarter choice. Thats why when you are getting help you need to make sure that the advise that the person is giving you is not too biased, or else you could make a wrong decision. If you are asking for advise, it is always a good idea to talk to more than one person because then you can get to hear from both sides of the story, and different people experience things in different ways so you can get a broader view of something. Getting help from different people makes your choice more objective in a difficult decision. Asking more people for advice will help you make a more educated answer on a topic, and will help realize what you should do. So, if you are in a situation were there are a lot\\xa0of people that can give you advise, why would you ever want to end up like Generic_Name, and not ask for it.   \\xa0\",\n",

These are examples of what could help students become a better student or become a better student athlete and those are Football, Math Clubs and the benefits of joining the clubs. Football is a great extracurricular activity its a great way for you to be a team working athlete and student. the sport is great for what it is but it teaches you a lot of team work. Football is great for being stronger especially with all the training. most of the training is footwork, how to be in a proper stance and just making sure your in the end zone\\xa0when they need you to be. Just because you play football doesnt mean they dont check your grades. Football coaches are always on you about your grades, your grades matter because you are a student athlete. the benefits of playing football is just making sure you have great time management because practices are long and might not have time to do all of your home work. i think football is great extracurricular activity Math club is another great extracurricular activity! its a great way for you to learn math and even compete if your great at the subject. math is a really hard subject you've gotta be onto of it and write lots of notes for you to get it, it takes a lot of time but it defenintly\\xa0gets u smarter and gets you into the mood to take notes for other classes. math is very hard, but doesnt mean you cant be great at it thats why they offer u opportunities to\\xa0compete in competitions. the benefits of being in a math club is always making sure u are good at the subject and just having good time management. football and math clubs are great extracurricular activities, but the benefits of it are what u need to know to succeed in them. Having good grades is huge for those extracurricular activities they wanna see that your doing good at school. In football they wanna make sure you understand that being a student athlete means to be doing good in school and making sure your smart about your decisions so u have time to do all your school work and other things outside of school and sports. for math club they want to see the same. they want to see that your doing great ins school and making sure you are being great at the subject you enjoy. Time management is a very important thing to be aware of. As an example if you had a 2 hour practice at 7:30-9:30 u should realize that right after school u should go home do school work or whatever is needed to be done before your practice and thats all done thats something called time management because you are aware of what u have to do and when u need to do it. reasons why kids should have extracurricular activities are just making sure they something to do during the day, especially with a subject they like or even maybe just to try something new. so having one extracurricular activity helps kids find something new and to enjoy to have some company during he day. this will even help kids get smarter in a subject they usually dont like or they could be good at it without even knowing and be great it so thats why i agree with kids having one extracurricular activities. football, math clubs and the benefits of the extracurricular activities is why i agree with having at least one extracurricular activities will help kids be smarter, have team working abilities, and of course being able to try something new or to do what they love!\",\n",

All these forms of transportation are drastically poluting the air due to the release of gas emission from the tailpipes. Some may say it\\'s easier to get around with a car handy. Others believe too many people are centered on a car. Cities should become denser for the public in order to transport and reduce gas emission at the same time. Up to 50% of car intensive areas are poluted in the United States as well as 12% in Europe. Drivning isn\\'t the only way to get around. In Vauban, Germany- some in the communtity have taken the pledge to give up thier cars and go green. In result to doing this, locations like garages are generally not used to hold a four wheel vehicle anymore. Instead this \"car free\" area is encouraging those to join the 70% of Vauban\\'s population to say goodbye to the waste product. In addition to a \"car free\" zone comes \"smart planning\". This is the practice of seperating the suburban life from auto use. In other words, creating a more condenced community will ensure more walkers instead of drivers. Similar to both the US and Germany, many areas have committed to giving up the cars. In Paris, pollution had gotten so bad they almost hit a record! Depending on the even or odd number license plate along with the day that came with it, people were ordered to leave their car and/or motor vehicle home or pay a 22-euro fine. Pollution was down 60% in France after the period of time enforcing the rule. In Bogota, Colombia most chose to walk, bike, skate, or take a bus to get around, leaving the city barren of any to no vehicles. With a capital of 7 million a goal was reached reducing smog throughout the city. Violators paid the price of $25 fines. Other research may suggest that leaving the cars home decreases some ability to get around at a decent time or may even cost just as expensive. Having somewhere to be and knowing you have to be their can be a haslte prioritizing your time. You have to calculate when you leave from both your home and the destination. Those who live in big cities will struggle even more from time to time. If cars on the street are limitted to taxis then the cost to get to a location will be as similar to that of a gas bill. Not only that but areas will require more taxi services to fill those needs of the people. Vehicles, the deathly poison of the human race, will continue to pollute the area unless something is done. Many areas have taken the step to create more suitible living conditions of the human race. Globally, we are reducing the exposure of gas emission everywhere.

I myself was diagnosed with ADHD and know that sometimes it is very hard to focus with lots of distractions going on in the room. To help students who also suffer from these problems, at home classes would help them benefit. With the ability to work at their own desired pace students will lose stress and work more fluidly and even become more independently thinking. While working at home there is also less distractions going on, such as a friend talking. Another group of students who may benefit from online classes are children and teens who suffer from extreme anxiety or depression disorder. These students may dread going to school and just the thought of it may freak them out, for example someone with social anxiety might not even want to go out into public because it could cause a panic attack. People who suffer from depression may see a lot of life as stressful or worthless and when they are put in a state where they are being stressed, such as presenting a project in front\\xa0of class, they find their self gaining a higher level anxiety putting them into a deeper state of depression. Quality of life is important, and there should be ways to work around these problems, like taking classes from home. In doing this students will be surrounded by an atmosphere they are more familiar to when placed in there own room, resulting in less stress and happier environment. Additionally, students who are sick weather it be from the common cold or a disease such as cancer, should not have to go to school. With colds constantly going around schools students are faced with missing school and missing work. Since some illnesses may cause a student to be out for more then a week, making up work can be difficult and their grade could reflect it. Providing classes at home will prevent the spread of viruses, like the flu, and give students with more concerning illnesses time to rest and finish there work more at their own pace. This would also solve the problem of to much make up work since the students can just work on it while away from school. Providing students with online classes is surly helpful\\xa0and could open the door for more students to really blossom while learning because of the environment they are in. I have experienced being home schooled\\xa0myself and even though it was not really for me because of the lack of people around me that I was used to, It was still helpful because of the weight\\xa0of not having to leave or be distracted off my back. Some who may disagree may say being at home is just a distraction of itself and there would to much to do, well trying it out is the only way to find out if this is true. The best way to implement this is give students to ability to do both, learn at school or at home, and not worry about attendants. The option for students to be schooled from home or school should be left to the student and his or her parents to decide once they are able to see and reflect on their grades and quality of life after trying both ways out.',\n",

In the 70\\'s they didn\\'t have to best cameras so it looked a little blury and came out to be a face. As cameras got better and better it became clearer and clearer.

Having to spend money on gas, making sure to not go over the speed limit, and being a safe driver at all times to avoid any accident. There are many advantages to limiting car usage. Such as helping out our economy and reducing pollution, having alternative ways to get places, and not spending money on a car. In not driving you would be the one to benefit from it. Living in a world that constantly looked beautiful and being able to breath in clean air would be a wonderful thing. We could all make this happen by not driving so often or at all. Cars let out gases that ruin our air. Excessive driving with all the fumes coming out damages our air. Not driving can make a remendous difference. In \"Paris bans driving due to smog\" according to Duffer in paragraph 5 he described, \"Congestion was down 60 percent in the capital of France, after five-days of intensifying smog.\" After banning driving, France managed to make a stunning change. Transportation is the second largest source of America\\'s emissions, just behind power plants. There are many alternative ways to get places. Such as riding a bus, walking, biking, and so much more. Public transportation is nothing to be afraid of. Doing so helps our community. In the passage \"In German Suburb, Life Goes on Without Cars\" according to Rosenthal in paragraph 7 he suggests, \"\\'All of our development since World War II has been centered on the car, and that will have to change,\\' said David Goldberg, and official of transportation for America, a fast-growing coalition of hundreds of groups in the United States . . . who are promoting new communities that are less dependent on cars.\" Spending money on a car takes big bucks. There are an abundant amount of other alternatives than spending money on a car that damages the ozone. There are other ways to put your money into good use than spending it on a car. The amount of people wanting to do this could lead to negative implications for the car industry. In \"The End of Car Culture\" according to the author in paragraph 6 she implies, \"Companies like Ford and Mercedes are already rebranding themselves \"mobility\" companies with a broader product range beyond the personal vehicle.\" In conclusion, there are many advantages of limiting car usage. Help not just your community, but the world. Every little thing matters, no matter how miniscule your action is. Not driving helps reduce greenhouse gas emissions, saves a big part of your money, and you have alternative options for transportation. Think of the ways you will be helping our world.    ',\n",

People of the United States should choose who they want to for president. Only having a few hundered out of the billions of people doesnt really seem fair to everyone\\'s opinion, I agree that not everyone\\'s opinion is satisfactory to others. Each candidate running for President in a certain state has their own group of electors. These electors are chosen by the political party of those candidates running. The state laws get involved by only selecting electors by their responsiblilities. So this means not every elector is involved with the process. We voters help choose our state\\'s electors when we vote for President. When we vote for the person of our choice we are really choosing the electors in that candidate\\'s political party. The \"winner-take-all\" system used in most states, gives the electors to the winning presidential candidate. this system is used in all states except Nebraska and Maine which have the variation of \"proportional repesentation.\" The number of electors chosen for your vote will representing your chosen candidate. Again with the fact of having a Electoral College, the people are not really voting for the President, they are voting for a slate of electors. Then they in turn elect president. If you lived in Texas, for instance, and wanted to vote for John Kerry, you\\'d vote for 34 Democratic electors for Kerry. Off chance that those 34 electors won statewide, they would go to Congress and Kerry would in return get 34 electoral votes. These electors can be anyone not holding publice office. Electors have their own opinion rights as well. Our votes dont always control who the elctors vote for. This causes confusion and arguements that it is unfair in the Electoral College\\'s ways that the people are not always voting for their president because they are giving a slight chance for electors to change that vote. Popular vote allows the people of the United States to choose what out of the majority is best for the United State\\'s Presidential candidate. Unlike the rules and rights of the Electoral College, the popular vote allows the voters a absolute vote. Everyone\\'s thoughts are put in concideration instead only 270 people out of like I said billions(and growing) population.

I believe that it would be a good idea for students to take part in community service but i don't think they should have to do it. Taking part in community service would have a huge effect on our surroundings. More students would be out helping out those who are in need instead of sitting around doing nothing. This would also cause the students to get more active and they would come to know those who live around them. Also, community service would look good on an application to college. If you don't want to go to college, so be it. The fact is that community service is a good thing and students should be encouraged to take part in community service. The encouragement of students to take part in community service should be increased. If a student does not know where to take part in community service or how to do it, then the odds of them trying to anything will go down. If signs or posters are hung up around the school then students mite pay more attention to their surroundings and get more active with their community. Even if they just went out side once a week to pick up garbage off the streets or even just around their house, it would make a huge difference to the community. Other students might even see a student or friend picking up trash and want to go out side to help that friend or student out. That would be causing the student to get active with their community and it would be helping out a lot of people. So as you can see, if students just do the smallest things then they can be helping out the community. The encouragement of the students toward community service would also impact the community because it would cause more students to get involved. Just the picking up of trash would make an impact.

Even if the principal cannot make the students do community service, she can at least do a school speech about how our city needs to be clean. Maybe the principal could bribe the students with a prize for the school if they all do community service. For instance, they could all go to a amusement park at the end of the year. The point is, wouldn't you want to have a clean environment and want to be able to breath in fresh air. Community service is not a punishment, it is a healthy way make our society clean. After you have served the community service you will have enough time to do what have had planned.

Not only does the system know when a student is confused, it also works on everybody and is very accurate. First off, this technology can tell weather a student is confused or bored. Many students, including myself, find it difficult to addmit when they do not understand something. If this system was in classrooms teachers would know when students do not understand the lesson. Instead of students being in the dark, and end up failing the test, teahers could pull the students aside and give them extra help. Not only can this technology tell when a student is confused, it can also tell when they are bored. In the text Dr. Huang says \"Then it could modify the lesson\" which I totally agree with. A student is not going to tell a teacher that they are bored, but with this technology a teacher can still find out. Finding out that a student is bored is great because teachers can modify the lesson to make the students engaged. The students will have more fun being taught with a more engaged lesson, which will raise test scores. Some people may say have this technology in class is werid or creepy, but if they students, teachers, and parents do not have a problem with it there should not be a problem. Secoundly, the Facial Action Coding System will work on anyone. In the artical it states \"the facial expresions for each emotion are universal\". This means that it does not matter who you are, or what you look like your results will be spot on. Since we all have the same muscles in our face, this technology will work on everybody.

Over the course of ten years, phones without cords have become commonplace. Many individuals use them while shopping, cooking, and exercising. There also use them while operating a vehicle. However, using any device while driving can cost thousands of dollars and even your life. Cellphones should not be used while operating a vehicle. The term distracted driving has become prevalent in courtrooms because drivers are more susceptible to the accessibility cellular devices, streaming services, and social networks provide. According to the auto insurance comparison search engine, The Zebra, approximately nine people are killed and over 1,000 people are injured from car accidents when one driver is preoccupied with their cell phone. This means that defensive drivers are not impervious on the road when another driver utilizes a cellular device. We, as a society, have the responsibility to keep others safe. The next time one sees their loved ones should not be on an autopsy table following an easily preventable car accident. The solution is to this dilemma is to enforce laws pertaining to cell phone usage and operators of vehicles. New drivers already face the challenge of utilizing their defensive driving in their daily lives. Many drivers, both new and experienced, would say that a notification on their phone takes a second to acknowledge. However, those who check messages risk their lives. According to Miller&Zois Limited Liabilities Company, a law firm based in Maryland, five seconds of viewing a text message is the amount of time it takes for car travelling at fifty-five miles per hour to drive across an entire football field. Therefore, if an individual decides to look at a notification or respond to a text message, that person could enter a river or cliff at that same speed by using a phone while driving. Citizens are not entirely at fault. According to the National Safety Council, cell phone use while driving is under-reported by law enforcement. This, in turn, means that too many offenders are only given warnings and no punishment for their reckless behavior. Tax-paying civilians are suffering because authorities do not hold offenders accountable for dangerous driving habits. Every state must outlaw phone use and produce punishments for those who continue to indulge in their distraction on the road, lest they seek for a steady increase in distracted driving injuries and fatalities. Humans are said to be social creatures. However, social behaviors will limit the focus of drivers. A single second is an ample amount of time to lose one\\'s life. Phones and driving are as compatible as water and oil. Do not post a picture, send a text message, read a book, or watch a movie when behind the wheel. Put the phone out of sight and out of reach.

I\\'m aware some students think that community service is a waste of time. I completely support this plan. Community service is away to interact with other people and helping them out. Students will be able to learn new things that could help them out in the future. They will also be distracted with better things than getting bored and doing something irresponsible. First of all some students get to caught up with work they don\\'t have time to interact with others. Community service can help students with that by helping others and not feeling so alone. Like this one girl i knew was so caught up with her studies all she did then was go into her room and lock herself up. Later , when i noticed she\\'d gone too far i told her to help me clean up the streets that were covered in litter. She did and then from then on she found time for her work, friends, and community service. Next, do you the saying \"you learn something new everyday.\" Well its true with community service you can learn things you never knew before. One time my aunt went to a park because of an oil spill and she helped out with cleaning the damage. While she was there someone who knew a lot about wild life taught her about the different species. Later in life we went for a walk and on the streets we saw a snake that looked like a very poisonous one, but my aunt with her new knowledge of wildlife knew exactly what it was. Good thing she went to that park for community service and learned about different animals. Lastly, haven\\'t you ever gotten bored. Everyone gets bored anytime. Well some students may get involved with something wrong while they are bored. Sometimes students get into drugs but instead of that they could do something useful. Community service can help keep kids of drugs and do something good. Of course I get bored all the time but when i do i usually help other people like mowing the lawn, gardening, babysitting and its all fun. So as you can I completely support your plan for requiring students do community service. It can help them for later on in life you never know. Learning new things and not getting into the wrong things is very important. Thank you for taking the time for reading my letter. Sincerely, Student',\n",

If you had to choose from killing yourself slowly or making the world healthier by walking instead of taking a car what would you choose? Many people don\\'t understand the damage that driving all of the time is doing to our world. But, limiting car usage has many advantages that come along with it. Limiting car usuage come along with many advatages. One advatage of limiting car usage is that you can limit the amount of smog that goes into the air and also into your lungs. In source 2 it says, \"After days of near-record pollution, Paris enforced a partial driving ban to clear the air of the global city. On Monday motorists with even-numbered license plates were ordered to leave their cars at home or suffer a 22-euro fine($31).\" That is a very good choice of action because without hearing that they would have any concequences people still would have drove their cars. In source 2 it also says, \"Congestion was down 60 percent in the capital of France, after five-days of intensifying smog...\" So, by limiting car usage just by the even numbered license plates there was less smog in just one day. In source 2 it says, \"The smog cleared enough Monday for the ruling French party to rescind the ban for odd-numbered plates on Tuesday.\" So, the success of just one day made people want to do it a second day with just the odd-numbered license plates. If they keep this up and eventually have a day where neither odd nor even numbered license plates can drive the smog will eventually clear all the way up. Also, another advantage to limiting car usage is there won\\'t be many traffic jams. In source 3 it says, \"In a program that\\'s set to spread to other countries, millions of Colombians hiked, biked, skated or took buses to work during a car-free day yesterday, leaving the streets of this captial city eerily devoid of ttraffic jams,\" meaning that everyone got around easily without all of the congestion in the roads. In source 3 it also says, \"It\\'s a good opportunity to take away stress and lower air pollution,\" said the businessman Carlos Arturo Plaza as he rode a two-seat bicycle with his wife.\" Traffic jams tend to cause alot of people stress. People stress because they can\\'t get to important places on time, they spend hours on the same highway, etc. By limiting car usage, they limit their stress and have a good day instead of being so angry just because of traffic which will help them out in the long run because alot of stress isn\\'t good for the body. There are many more advantages to limiting car usage. In source 4 it says, \"pedestrian, bicycle, private cars, commercial and public transportation traffic are woven into a connected network to save time, conserve resources, lower emissions and improve safety.\" By just taking the little time to figure out a different, less polluting way of transportation all of these advantages come out of it. Many people don\\'t understand the damage that driving all of the time is doing to our world. But, limiting car usage has many advantages that come along with it. A way that I could pitch in would be to ride the school bus with everybody else instead of driving myself to school. Some advantages to that would be using less gas, saving money and carpooling so that there are less cars on the road and less air pollution, because we need the air to stay clean so we can breathe and stay alive. So by limiting car usage we can have many good things happen to our lives and to our world .    ',\n",

Personal issues and family issues may be an impact to your learning. Not all students are fortunate enough to be available to internet access or access to technology as in computers or laptops. Procrastination, distractions, and no access to internet are reasons to why distance learning is not beneficial. Distance learning brings alot of procastination. Procastination is something that every human being will do. We tend to put things aside, and sometimes never finish. When we get comfortable, we forget. Students who work, procastinate the most. For example, I usually work until 11pm, so when I am backed up on a lot of homework, in all honesty, I choose to stay home. I end up sleeping in, never finishing the work I told myself I\\'d do. Clearly, When you\\'re put to be at home to learn, you continuously tell yourself that you will eventually do it, you end up either turning it in late, rushing the assignments that lead to bad grades, or not turning in anything at all. When you\\'re physically at school, you recieve support and encouragement from teachers, which in most cases eliminates procrastination. Procrastination will impact your learning when doing online classes. Distractions is a huge problem students will face when trying to complete online classes. Everyday isn\\'t a good day. Sometimes you have personal issues and emotional feelings that will distract you from finishing your assignments. On the other hand, when you\\'re at school you tend to hold off on personal issues until you get home. Some students who do online courses have different times of completing daily assignments and some choose evenings to work mornings. Therefore, in the evenings, students will face family distractions. Evenings is the time families start arriving from work or school. For example, my sister used to do online classes to be able to graduate on time, she would go to work early in the mornings, and complete online tasks in the evenings. We have a lot of younger siblings who make alot of noise, which was a huge distraction to her. She would put aside the work until 8pm to be able to complete her assignments in peace. The result in leaving her assignments until late, caused her exhaustion in trying to keep up with her job and school work. Online classes is not benficial for those with families, which is majority of the people. Interent access and availability of technology is something not every student is fortunate enough to have. In order to complete, they would have to use a type of transportation to go to a public library, in which, not all students have. Nowadays, you would expect everybody to have some sort of technology because of the type of society we live in. Last year, around spring time, I met a very sweet kid who was bullied for not having a phone or a tv in his house. He proceeded with a story of abuse from his father and how his father denied him anything with technology. He lived five houses down the street and I offered him to come sit in my house if he needed to complete any assignments. He then told me his father didn\\'t let him out the house. Clearly, not every single person is available to internet and technology. Sometimes you might have a laptop and some wifi, but when times get rough and your family can\\'t pay for wifi anymore, you won\\'t be able to complete your assignments, causing you to fail. It\\'s a risk you should not take. On the other hand, if you\\'re at school you\\'re not denied the use of school wifi or technology. To sum up, school from home, also called distance learning, is a choice students have in some schools. Distance learning will not benefit students who attend classes at home. Students will face daily challenges in order to finish online classes. There is less good benefts than bad benefits when it comes to distance learning. Students will most likely get too comfortable and put aside work, making them procrastinate, deal with personal and emotional issues causing distractions, lastly, the challenges of having available internet access and an available electric device.',\n",
       " \"Paraphrase the following text upto same length: I am a NASA scientist and you don't believe the evidence we have. You just want to believe that they were created by aliens. Really? I feel like we, at NASA, have all the evidence to prove to you non-believers that the Face was not created by aliens, but only appears to be a face because of the pictures you have seen. We have beeter pictures and I am going to prove to you, that the Face was not created by aliens. I am going to tell you why the Face isn't created by aliens, but is just a rock. First, the Face is made out to be a face because of the picture taken in 1976 by one of NASA's spacecrafts,Viking 1. It was a picture taken by accident while Viking 1 was searching for its sister ship, Viking 2. It was taking pictures of possible landing sites for Viking 2. So, the picture was taken by accident, with not the best camera that was available. It might have been the best one at the time but better cameras were developed over time. Second, when the mission controllers at the Jet Propulsion Lab recieved these photos on their moniters they must have been surprised but they soon figured that it was just another Martian mesa, because it was common around Cydonia, only the mesa had unusual shadows to make it look like an Egyptian Pharaoh. Lastly, few scientists believed that the Face was an alien artifact, so getting photographs became a main priority for NASA, about eighteen long years after the Viking missions ended. So, when the Mars Global Surveyor flew over Cydonia for the first time, it gather a picture that was ten times sharper than the original Viking photos. So for those non-believers of factual evidence, the picture was revealed to actually be a natural landform. Which is why the so called Face that was created by aliens, was not created by them after all. If you don't believe me still I'm pretty sure that I have showed you all of the evidence that proves you wrong. You could try to say that the second picture was still not close enough and it was cloudy. Well, the Mars Global Surveyor got close enough for a second look, and the third picture taken in 2001 had each pixel that spaned 1.56 meters compared to the Vikings 43 meters per pixel. I have presented all the evidence to prove to you that the Face was not created by aliens but is just like a butte or mesa-landforms common around the American West. I am right.          \",\n",

My principal has decided that everyone must take part in an extracurricular activity. I disagree with his decision because some students may not have time, no one to take them, or not enough money. Students may not have enough time to do everything they need to do and go somewhere. Sometimes they have to finish their studying, homework, and go to a game or practice. They could also have a job or have to help out on a farm. For example, I had so much homework and studying to do, but I could not get it all done and go to practice. As a result I stayed home and did my homework and studying instead of going to practice. Because I did not have enough time, I could not do an extracurricular activity. Some students do not have someone to take them to games and practices. Their parents may not be able to take them because they work late or they have to go somewhere after work. One time my mom had to work late but, I also had cheer practice. Because I had no one to take me to practice, I had to stay home and miss a practice. Some times students can not participate because their families do not have enough money. Their parents need money so they can take them to and from places; also, they have to pay to get in games and for insurance. One time I wanted to do dance, but I could not do it because we did not have enough money. Because we did not have enough money to pay for it, I was not able to do an extracurricular activity.

But I believe this issue is never going to go away unless we work our way around it. We are now in the twentieth century, technology is a big thing, especially to us teenagers. I believe that is a great idea to allow students to bring their cell phones to school and use them during our lunch periods and other free times, as long as the cell phones are turned off during class time. I can understand why you wouldn't want to have cell phones during school hours. Some people might say it's a distraction, having students using their phones in class or their cell phones to go off during a lecture. Or some people just don't want students to have cell phones at all. But I say we should but the cell phones to good use. Almost everybody has a cell phone, is one of the biggest technology used everyday. But I think we can do better then just using cell phones during free time and during lunch. I believe that we should use them in class. If we use projectors, computers, and other technical devices why not cell phones? Most cell phones have calculators, let you take notes, and much more. A student always have their cell phone with them, so they could study more frequently. You can't carry a notebook around all the time like you do a cell phone. You could also record a lesson and watch it or listen to it when you don't understand, sometimes just reading and going over notes isn't enough. Less people would be getting in trouble if cell phones weren't an issue. Of course there are going to be times when a child is caught not following the rules, but everyone messes up were only human. Teenagers are always going to be tempted to break the rules. If you tell them they can't use their cell phones, they are going to be tempted to do it, and some people will. Not allowing students to have cell phones would very much upset them. Most schools make the students put their cell phones in their locker. But most of them won't, if they put their cell phone in their locker they are most likely going to forget it and leave it at school. Which would lead to more problems. Most people are very dependent to their cell phones. So telling them that can't have it will not work. Students will always have their cells phones so why not work around it and maybe use them? But if you can't use them during class perhaps just allowing students to use their cell phones during lunch and other free times is a wonderful idea. it's nice to just have fun at school every once in awhile, especially if your cramped up in a classroom for several hours. We are young adults I believe we can handle it. I hope you take what I said into deep consideration and allow us to use our cell phones.\",\n",

       " \"Paraphrase the following text upto same length: I believe that students can benefit from attending classes at home. Many students have a safer learning environment when learning at home than at schools. Since majority of students have access to the internet and have computers at home, connecting to online classes wouldn't be an issue. Most students have a hard time waking up early in the morning; if they were to take online classes, students would be able to get more sleep and be able to focus easier. Students can benefit from online learning because they have a more comfortable learning environment and a less stressful schedule. My first reason to why students would benefit from online classes, is that they have a more comfortable environment.\\xa0Students can work in their pajamas while doing online assignments, however, if they are in a video conference with a teacher, they must be dressed somewhat appropriate. Being at home can help students be more focused on their work and do much better on assignments. Students will avoid distracting classmates and getting in trouble with their friends when at home. For example, whenever students see their friends, they immediately want to talk and joke around with them, which could lead to them getting in trouble with the teacher. Unfortunately, some students have to deal with classmates that bullies and discourages them, but they wouldn't have to deal with them if they are at home. If students took classes online at home, all these reasons could improve a student's education. My second reason why students could improve their education through online classes is that they would have a less stressful schedule. Most students like to sleep in, but as long as they complete their assignments the same day, students can sleep for as long as they want. For example, students who attend schools have to a wake up from around 5am to 6am to be on time for school; while students who take online classes can wake up on their own time. Since students don't have to arrive at school; they do not have to worry about missing the bus or be ready when someone to comes pick them up. Most importantly, students may eat meals and snacks whenever they would like and not have to follow their school's lunch schedule. However, students must make sure their computer is charged so they can complete their all assignments. In conclusion, there are many positive outcomes from attending classes at home than at school. It can be easier for students to focus, they don't have to worry about other students, they can work in pajamas, students can wake up later on, students don't have to worry about missing the bus, and students may eat whenever they like. All of these reasons help prove that students may receive greater benefits from online classes at home.\",\n",

Without after school activities students wouldn't of made as many friends as they have made. When I was in an extracurricular class we got to know the teacher better and see what she had to teach us. I met one of my friends today at an extracurricular activity because\\xa0we had the same interest in soccer. I agree that students should have to participate in one extracurricular\\xa0activity so they can meet new students, be active, and learn more about a subject. Extracurricular activities educate students about a specific topic that the students are interested in. For example, I was in the soccer club in 6th grade and we learned about the history of the sport and how it started. The robotics club is where students learn about building and technology. It can help students learn tips and tricks about architecture and how to build things. That can help them in the long run if they want to join a field that uses robotic and architecture. It also teaches students how to work with others to solve a problem. Extracurricular activities serve as good learning chances for students. By taking extracurricular classes students get to meet new students and make friends. The students have common interest so they can talk to others and make friends. An extracurricular activity would be good for a shy student so they can get out of their comfort zone in a small group of people. Students can learn to share their ideas in an extracurricular activity because it is a small group and them they can get more comfortable to do it normal school. These friends can transfer over to normal school so kids that are quiet and don't have any friends will have someone to talk to, someone to work with during group work and, a friend. Extracurricular activities can help students make friends and come out of their comfort zone. Being active is an important part of daily life. Extracurricular activities can help students be more active. They give students something to do after school other than homework and sports. Students can catch up with their friends they haven't seen all day and give their parents a break. Extracurricular activities are good for teachers if they are bored and want to teach and have fun with their students. Extracurricular activities also count as the sports teams so you can be active by joining a sports team. For example, I joined the soccer club so i could be active. It was really fun and a good way to be active. Extracurricular activities are a good way to be healthy and active. Extracurricular activities gives lots of opportunities to students. They should make it mandatory to participate in at least one extracurricular activity. The activities have lots to give to the students. They should be mandatory for them so they can learn more and expand their view of learning. Extracurricular activities helps kids come out of their comfort zone and make friends.

You can understand the topic or the work that you all are working on. Some students might also like working at school better because you get more help, and you can work in groups to understand the work a lot beter. In some other cases I think working in a classroom is more beneficial because it helps you pass your grade and get you to where you need to be ahead of your life. Most students think it is easier to go to school at home. They think it is easier to go to school at home rather than at a real school because you have more sleep time. You can still enjoy the rest of your day without going to school. I think most parents would prefer their kids going to school, and being in a classroom so they can understand the lesson, know how to do it, and know what the teacher is talking about. Going to school at home can not help you pass the grade, go to the next grade, or graduate from high school, because at home you are not learning anything. Working at a school would be more beneficial because you can have conferences with your childs teacher to see how they are doing in all of their classes. You can see if they are missing any work or haven't completed any ol their work. Most students like to skip class or leave school, so they never get good grades or so they will not have to do the work. Some students may get things wrong in some of heir classes but they still manage to try and do the work. Ohers may think the work is very difficult and challenging so they ask for help to understand the lesson so that they can get the work done. In conclusion, I think working at school where you can get more help is way easier than working at home where you don't undrstand it at all and you have to struggle to figure out how to do all of your work.\\xa0 \\xa0\",\n",

That\\'s why i 100% disagree with the principals decision because students already have so much pressure at school,at home with chores and homework, and with trying to make time for family. School is nothing but pressure to get good grades so we can pass the grade that were currently resigned in,why would you add more to that pressure then we already have by adding extracurricular activities? Most of us who attend public schools already know the difficulties of trying to get our grades up with stuff going on at home or at school. For example drama ,drama, drama. Most of us have experience this because we attend a public school and you will experience drama at least a couple times in your middle school years,therefore bringing more and more pressure and stress on us. Family time is a really big thing you should focus on,not extracurricular activities. According to my school 70% of middle school students who play sports or stay back a lot\\xa0for school related activities miss out on family time. Pretty much all they can do is go home,eat dinner,shower, and go to sleep for the next day. Sounds pretty tiring to me.

If were \"busy\" with extracurricular activities such as sports,yearbook, and student council how are we suppose to keep up with our chores or our homework.

I never had time for anything i use to get home at 7,eat,shower, and then go straight to bed. My mom would always walk in my room and ask if i did my homework, but i would always be asleep because of how tired i was.

For one, if you decided to go with policy 2, you would most likely find a lot of students getting caught with cell phones. Taking away the cell phone privilege from students is bad and good in a way. Its bad because students wouldn't be able to communicate with their parents very well, so they would end up trying to hide it from the teacher, and getting caught in class and during passing time. It would be good because teachers would spend less time taking phones away, but actually teaching the class instead. Students do need phone time. Their parents might be trying to get a hold of them for an emergency, so if no phones are aloud, the student would never be able to return that call or text. If phones were aloud, that student would be able to communicate and return that missed call to that parents emergency or needs. Having a no cell phone at all policy would lead to many phones getting taken away and many other problems involving a phone. If I were the principal, I would go with policy 1.

For example: I'm taking one class online and is not the same as if I take it in my school, because like I said there's no teacher to explain it to me how to do it. Also, I have some friends and they are taking classes online either and they say that it's a little bit difficult for them understand those classes, because there is no one to teach them how to do what they have to do.

As technology is advancing and more of the classroom is found through an electronic device, some students may find themselves losing interest in their daily lessons. What if this could be changed by a system that takes your facial expressions into account and accomodates to your mood? Right when the assignment has begun to lose your interest, this system could sense the change and alter the lesson plan to regain your interest. The Facial Action Coding System may be valuable and allow for improvement to be made within classrooms and within students. Initially, as technology is advancing daily and students find themselves online more often, this system could improve their lessons. Electronics as of now are programmed to teach a student however are unable to sense how the student is feeling or how they are actually doing on their assignment. As the author states in the article, \"most human communication is nonverbal, including emotional communication\" something which computers are unable to detect (para. 6). Not only this, but the author gives an analogy that states \"if you smile when a web ad appears on your screen, a smilar ad might follow\" and explains that in a classroom, similar techniques can be applied to benefit the student (para. 6). Using this program will allow technology to advance and in turn will benefit the student. By the same token, using this sort of technology in the classroom will keep a student engaged during their lessons. When Dr. Huang describes how this system can engage a student he states, \"[the computer] could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored\" and further explains that \"[the system] could modify the lesson\" to acomidate to the students needs (para. 6). In a normal classroom, when the teachers method of teaching is confusing students, the teacher should find a different way of teaching to engage students. The author also explains how the system is able to read six different emotions and can \"identify mixed emotions\" to allow the system to see if their methods are benefitting the student (para. 4). This computer system would be valuable when keeping the students engaged. Finally, this system may change the ways in which many students view school. It is no secret that many students dread coming to school, whether it be from stress, bullying, or simply not understanding the subjects. This system can pick up on a fake emotion, the author explains how it can read a \"fake smile\" and that to them \"faces don\\'t lie\" (para. 8). If this system is able to sense when a student is unhappy or angry, this could be used as an advantage in helping the student. Not only this, but the author explains that \"moving your facial muscles not only expresses emotions, but may even help produce them\" (para. 9). Taking both of these statements into account, and allowing them to be incorporated into the classroom, students may enjoy attending school and learning new things. Consequently, this system would be valuable to classrooms and would allow for improvement to be made within schools and the students. Overall, it is evident that computers are unable to read emotions and reciprocate to the individual adequately. This system might prove to reengage students in their learning, and improve their moods altogether. If you had the choice to experience in this program within your classroom, what do you thing the outcomes may be? ',\n",

A lot of people in other countries such as germany and Paris have given up their cars or vehicles completely. First off, places have taken away the ability to park. \"street parking, driveways and home garages are generally forbidden in this experimental new district\"(S1P2). This quote shows that they have taken away the right to park in certain places. \"there are only two places to park large garages at the edge of the development, where a car owner buys a space, for $40,000, along with a home\"(S1P2). This quote shows how they are limiting areas to park so not many people buy cars. Second off, Motorized vehicles are causing a lot of smog. \"Congestion was down 60 percent in the capital of France, after five-days of intesifying smog\"(S2P14). This quote shows that the smog is building up because of cars. \"motorists with even numbered license plates were ordered to leave their cars at home or suffer a 22 euro fine\"(S2P11).

       " \"Paraphrase the following text upto same length: Various schools agree that summer is the optimal period for learning; however, they are indecisive over the issue of designating teacher-designed or student-designed projects as the prominent method for students to prepare for the next school year. Many teachers spend time creating projects for students to ensure students have an adequate grasp for their oncoming course. Additionally, schools mirror the success of other schools by attributing the idea of summer projects into their own curriculum. Students often procrastinate on summer projects because the summer projects do not captivate their attention, and they view the assignment only as a complementary task. While some schools may argue that teacher-designed projects align with the concepts addressed in class, student-designed projects enable students to discover ideas individually and increase retention time for them. Student-designed projects provoke a stronger understanding of a topic because students spend time garnering information and relating it with current events. For example, incoming A.P. Spanish students need to familiarize themselves with content which relates to the themes covered in the class. They may design a poster for each theme by organizing current events under an example column and summarizing the most pertinent details found from their research. Student-designed projects benefit students because students are inspired to conduct research on the topic, and students are not limited to guidelines. They promote a higher capacity for creativity because students expand beyond the parameters of the subject and force students to actively engage with the project. The flexibility of student-designed projects can cover a topic more comprehensive than teacher-designed projects because they stretch beyond just the bare bones\\xa0of a topic. Semantic encoding, the act of obtaining memories by relating information directly to the source, increases retention time because the students grapple with the topic, and they encode the information to long-term memory. By storing the information in long-term memory, students can prolong the retention curve, a graph that depicts an increase in memory loss as time increases. Teacher-designed projects provide a snapshot of the course because they contain significant elements that are modeled after the course's itinerary. At the end of the school year, tenth grade English teachers dish out a list of recommended books to give students a head start on the book review project due shortly after the break. The book review project requires identifying the author's argument and tone which helps students develop the skills required for the analytic essay component of the A.P. Language and Composition exam. Teacher-designed projects expose students to a strict interpretation which allow students to extrapolate the necessary ideas and disregard the trivial details. They are not intensive to complete because their primary function is to spark interest with students and are merely a precursor to the course. Although they may abide by the topics of a course, they fail to prepare students for the challenges of the course. On the contrary, student-designed projects require huge amounts of effort and incorporate additional information that can allow students to gain a deeper understanding than teacher-designed projects. Teacher-designed projects can limit the perspective of students because they follow the same perspective of the teacher who designed it; meanwhile, student-designed projects can allow students to gain a global perspective of the topic and de-emphasize the focus of students on themselves but on other issues occurring throughout the world. Although schools utilize teacher-designed projects for summer learning because they stay within the confines of the teacher's syllabus, student-designed projects are ideal in fostering intellectual growth for students because students are permitted to seek a plethora of sources which enhances their learning and they strengthen their retention of the subject due to constant exposure with the material. In a foreign language class, students are given the opportunity to design their own projects. As such, they expand on their Spanish comprehension because they rely on their own research to provide prototypes that can be incorporated into the course, and their homework is easier because they can cite current events as examples in their essays. In an English class, students are given a teacher-designed project to experience the superficial\\xa0concepts of the course. The lack of challenge offered by teacher-designed projects is devastating to a student's mastery of a course and impacts the view that students have on a topic because they may be biased at a certain topic. One effective way to implement student-designed projects is to provide a list of the topics covered in a course and allow students to approach the project by choosing the format that suits them rather than a rigid structure that may put off students from completing the task.\\xa0   \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0   \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0\",\n",

This photo that was taken on NASA\\'s Viking 1 spacecraft, as it was searching for possible landing sites. This \"face\" is nothing but a natural landfrom that happens to look like a face. There are many persuasive and factual reasons to back up the fact that there has been no alien formation on Mars. First, there has been no real, hard evidence that this human-like figure is actually a face. The article \"Unmasking the Face on Mars,\" even says,\"it spotted the shadowy likeness of a human face.\" (Notice, it said likeness.) Just because one article and a Hollywood movie says that this was alien created, doesn\\'t mean it really was. Also, any natural landforms can look like something it is not. Have you ever looked at a rock or even a cloud and said, \"Wow, that looks like a [insert object or name]!\" There have been plenty of instances in which something has been mistaken to be someting it is not. For example, The Little Dipper, as we call it, is said to look like a spoon. Does that mean that there is a big, shiny spoon in the sky? Of couse not, so why should we say the same about a formation of rocks on Mars that happen to look like a face. Lastly, NASA has even confirmed that this is just a natural rock formation. I know this because, NASA unveiled an image of this \"face\" and captioned it, \"huge rock formation...which resembles a human head... formed by shadows giving the illusions of eyes, nose, and mouth.\" So, this rock\\'s shadows have given the illusion of a human-like face, which leads to the assumption that there is no real face. You might be thinking,\" Well, why did the people who discovered this even release the information if it wasn\\'t comepletely factual.\" This is beacuse of the conspiracy theorists. Think about it , if you would have never heard about this Face on Earth in books, magazines, and radio talk shows, would you have believed it? NASA is a very trustworthy and credible association and if information wasn\\'t released until it was proven true than none of this would have happened. In conlusion, the Face on Earth is nothing but a myth, until there are reliable discoveries that have declared it real. Since there is no evidence that there has been alien formation on Earth, it is just a hoax. I hope I have given a sufficent amount of reasons to argue that the Face is not a face.          ',\n",

With new technology called FACS(Facial Action Coding System), it will be able to detect when kids are feeling this way. The computer makes a 3-D model face of a human and have all 44 major musles that operates like human musles, then it scans the face of a real human which will then identify what the person is feeling right now such as happy, sad, tired, scared and many more. Using this type of technology will be very helpful in classrooms because when a student is feeling bored or tired then the computer will be able to detect that the the teacher will be able to make the topic more interesting for the students. Most teachers have about 28 students per class for seven periods everyday which can be very stressful, so it can be very challenging for them to recognize when students are dealing with a certain type of emotion but with the FACS it can recognize that and the teacher will be able to help the student or students. In conclusion, FACS is an amazing creation that will be able to help students and teachers. Kids learn the most when they're happy and when the subject they're learning is fun and very interesting and when they're in a good environment.

Due to unfortunate circumstances some students don't receive this equal opportunity, and they can not attend public school with their peers.\\xa0By offering distance learning courses to all students this issue could be resolved. A program like the distance learning program would give every child the chance to go to public school if they wish. The program would be simple; students could attend school from home via online or video conferencing. If more schools were to adopt this simple solution more students would be able to go to school and learn alongside their peers. Students would benefit from being able to attend classes from home because students and their families would not have to worry about transportation to and from school, some students are too anxious about going to a public school, and for some students it is the only option. Students would benefit from being able to attend classes from home because students and their families would not have to worry about transportation. The journey to school is different for every student. For some an easy five minuet walk will get them to school with no worries, others a fifteen minuet bus ride, and for few a treacherous\\xa0path lies between their house and their nearest public school. This situation could prevent a child from attending a public school at all, or make it very difficult to attend everyday. The family shouldn't have to move from the house they love for their children to attend school. The distance learning program would be able to fix this situation. Fortunately for the family, with the distance learning program, the student would be able to video conference the schools from the comfort of their home. Personally, I know a program like this would benefit families like my cousins family who lives far out of the way and struggles to drive to school every morning because public school transportation does not go far enough to reach where they live. This program would take the stress off the family and continue to allow the student to attend public school. In addition to taking the stress off families about transportation, students would benefit from being able to attend classes from home because some students are too anxious about going to a public school. Due to recent events, the anxiety of there being a school shooting has gone up in many students. Some students live in fear of being in the next school shooting. For some the anxiety is overwhelming and it makes the student no longer want to physically attend public school. This anxiety could also become distracting while in the public school setting taking the students attention away from learning and instead worrying about the possibility. This should not be a reason any student is unable to learn how any other student would in a public school. With the distance learning program students with this anxiety would be able to virtually attend school with peace of mind from their home. Programs like the distance learning program would help give more students peace of mind which would help a lot in times like these. Lastly, students would benefit from being able to attend classes from home because for some students it is their only option. For some students schooling from home is their only option. For example some students have health issues preventing them from attending public school. They could be too sick or vulnerable to be around all the other students. Although for many of these students they wish to attend public school with their peers to feel like every other student their age. The distance learning program would be giving these students the opportunity to study among their peers in a public school setting. While some may say the video conferencing would be a distraction to students, it would be giving students who are unable to attend public school physically the chance to learn the way all other students who can attend public school physically do. In conclusion, students would benefit from being able to attend classes from home because students and their families wouldn't have to stress over transportation to and from school, some students are too anxious about going to a public school, and for some students it is the only option. This program would benefit not only students but also the school in many ways. Plus there are little to no downsides.

       " 'Paraphrase the following text upto same length: NASA often wonders about each planet and if they can support human life. They often send astronauts out to explore the other planets in our solar system and see what lies on the surface. Related to Earth, Mars and Venus are the only other two planets that relate most to the Earth in ways such as climate and being able to support human life. Studies have been done on Mars and the studies show that Mars is very similar to the Earth but they have not yet determined if the planet can provide life for humans. But what about Venus? It is very similar to Earth as well but why have no studies been recorded on Venus? Venus is often called the \"Evening star\" but it isn\\'t actually a star, it\\'s a planet. Venus is also called \"Earth\\'s twin\" because of it\\'s similarity in size and density to Earth. Venus, Earth and Mars all orbit the Sun, but at different speeds. These different speeds often result in humans being able to see Venus as if it is a star. Many spacecrafts have been sent to Venus to conduct stuides but none have ever been successful due to the conditons of Venus\\' surafce. I think that if humans could find a way to safely observe Venus and determine it\\'s climate and what is on the surface, then it would be worth the risk of getting close to the planet. Astronomers wonder why the conditions of Venus are the way they are such as being draped in a thick layer of carbon dioxide and what could have caused it. They are also fascinated by the fact that Venus could have been able to sustain oceans like Earth does at one time but they just haven\\'t found a way to get down the the surface yet. I think if NASA could find a way to get down to the surface of Venus it would be important because they could possibly come up with an answer as to why Venus is not able to support life. The terrain of Venus is very similar to Earth, such as having hills, valleys, and mountains which makes astronomers wonder if human life could have actually lived on this planet at one time. But if humans could actually get down to the surface of Venus we could possibly determine what is causing the carbon dioxide blanket or what is causing the conditions of Venus to become so extreme. Many people wonder, \"well how could humans get down to Venus without risking their lives?\" Humans cannot actually get down to the surface of Venus and have enough time to roam the surface of the planet and observe the causes of it\\'s conditions because of the temperature and pressure beneath the cloud of carbon dioxide. Although these conditions are life threatening, NASA has came up with an idea to study and observe from a farther perspective. Planes hover over storms in order to keep passangers safe so NASA has came up with an idea to build a blimp like vehicle. This vehicle will be able to hover 30 or so miles above the atmosphere of Venus. By performing this experiment, humans will be able to safely observe the surface of Venus without putting themselves at any risk. Although if this experiment were to actually happen, the temperatures would still be very high but the air pressure would be suitable for humans. The other let down of being able to stay above the atmosphere of Venus is that not enough light would be able to shine through the atmosphere of Venus so that humans could have a clear visual as to what is on the surface. It would help human curiosity if this experiment could be conducted but many other risks play a big role in ths experiment as well. We have to think about the right materials needed in order to safely send humans into space near Venus and to also make sure they are able to safely return to Earth. If we send humans up into space we also want to make sure they have the proper equipment to keep themselve safe. They would also need to have a backup plan/procedure in case something were to go wrong. A humans curiosities about Venus can be met but the correct knowledge and protection qualifications have to be met first in order to conduct the experiment safely.    ',\n",

In paragraph 3 it talks about how the fce is just a natural landfor. Saying it is just a rock formation. Also it says that the shadows just give it the illoution of being a face.

Personal space is something that might be broken by trying to aquire students feelings and emotions through a laptop. Hypothetically speaking , when your friend is upset you can see this emotion clear as day, and if you ask them what's wrong and you don't get a response, you may ask around to see if anyone knows, but hopefully you'd never try and put their face into a computer and try to read their emotions. Another value to the everyday human that would be broken is privacy. The Mona Lisa might have been able to be read because it was a painting of what a young lady was feeling like eons ago, so it couldn't tell you if it wanted to be read or not, but a human being should have the right to express their emotions out loud or keep it to themselves, depending on how they feel about. Using a computer to tell their emotions just totally breaks all the rules to privacy, especially when it's being performed by a teacher or other students, which in hand would also waste time in the classroom. I say time would be wasted in the classroom, because the paragraph states that in order for the computer to know how you're feeling, it first has to make a 3-D model of your face, and then it has to do its calculations on forty-four of your facial muscles. This generally is not a one, two, three done process. This process takes time to scan everything needed and then produce results, which means instead of using your time in class to learn and prepare for standardized tests, you're worried and focusing on scaning someones emotions which can change within the next hour. All together I believe that gettinf technology to read emotions in classrooms would be a waste of time and money, and most importantly a violation against human rights. If you want to help your friend who's upset in school, then try to talk to them or give them space, but besides that, lets give the fancy emotional technology to the doctors and people in that field of work and keep school school.       \",\n",

Since you don't know whether the advice is good or not, its better to listen to different opinions from different people, in order to make better decisions. For example, in four year i'll be going to college.When i'm choosing which college to go to, I will ask several people for advice. I'll ask my mom and dad to see how much money we have. Asking them can help me choose college that are not so expensive. Then i'll ask my siblings what they did after high school. One of them is planning to attend SCHOOL_NAME soon, and he told me that is a really good college for studying law. From hearing that, I might add SCHOOL_NAME to my list. Finally I'll ask my counselor where I should go, since she knows what my strength are and what my weakness are. She can suggest which college suits me the best. Hearing those advice from different people can help me choose the best college to attend. After I enrolled in college, I will ask my parents for advice. They told me in college, studying is way more important than socializing. They also warned me to be careful and surround myself with people that will bring positive change in my life. After hearing from them, I asked my friends what they would do. They told me they would party all night and drink alcohol. Comparing my parents advice with my friends, obviously, my parent's advice are much better. It's always better to ask more people than one so you don't make a mistake. College means independent life, before graduating high school, ask more people for advice! Everyone have different opinions, choose which one is best and which one will help you the most!\",\n",
       " \"Paraphrase the following text upto same length: Driverless cars would have never crossed our mind 50 years ago, but today, they are already being developed and tested. Driverless cars are wrong beacuse they could cause a lot more accidents from technology malfunctions, they could potentially cause many law suits and problems in our world, and they will make humans even more technology dependent and incapable of taking care of themselves if somehow we lost all electricity and had to operate cars by ourselves. Driverless cars are owned and operated by the company who makes them, humans have little to no control on what happens in the car. So if the car crashes, would it be the manufacturers fault or the humans fault? Driverless cars could potentially cause many unneccesary arguments and law suits between manufacturers and consumers. If someone is riding in the driverless car, and the car crashes, the manufacturers should be the ones to blame unless they develop a technology to enable the humans to take complete control if neccesary. Many arguments could be made that the manufacturer didn't program the car correctly anf that is why the person was injured or even so much as killed. This could result in manufacturers of big companies paying millions maybe even billions of dollars in law suits. Driverless cars could cause a lot more accidents because there isn't someone physically watching the surroundings of the car, and technology as simple as calculators can malfunction sometimes, so would you really trust a car run by a computer with your life? Driverless cars have no human physically driving unless it enables the human to drive, and even then it will be hard to avoid the accident because the car wouldn't inform the human about the incident unles just milliseconds before it happens because they can't predict the future and neither can we. The amount of accidents would most likely skyrocket if driverless cars became an everyday thing because of the lack of control and responsibilty a human has in the car. Today we have many different things that involve technology. We have phones that we depend on for almost everything we do in life, we have computers which we use to store information, we have calculators so we don't even have to remember how to do simple math on our own. Almost everything we do in life has some sort of technology to make our lives easier. Now we might not even have to drive our own car. Driverless cars could mean that people never have to learn how to drive, and then what would happen if for some reason the world lost all electricity, wifi, and communication signals? That means no more phones computers, calculators, and no driverless cars. People are so dependent on technology today that giving them another thing to be dependent on to not have to drive themselves is going to cause a lot of problems if the world has an extreme crisis. Hardly anyone would know how to drive, which means very little transportation and it will be ahrder to communicate with people. Driverless cars should be illegal because it could potentially cause ven more uneeded law suits and arguments, it could cause a lot more deaths in car accidents, and it would make people very uneducated on how to get places if the technology somehow stopped working. The world is just fine driving themselves, and on top of everything else we depend on technology for, it would be nice to keep at least one thing we have to do for ourselves just for the sake of human independency. If we create driverless cars, we will truly not have anything left to do for ourselves and there will be extreme crisises if something were to happen to our electricity.   \",\n",

Many big names that specialize in different aspects of technology are working on driverless cars. Some of the biggest are Google, BMW, and Tesla. People have long dreamed of driverless cars, and in the 1950s GM tried \"smart roads\" as a solution, but was soon disregarded because of the cost. Almost all the successful driverless cars have been producted by big successful companies that are household names. Google is highly respected and is working on a driverless cars, and in total those cars have driven more than half a million miles. In those half a million miles not a single crash has happened. BMW is also helping solve problems with driverless cars by intoducing \"Traffic Jam Assistant.\" This new technology requires the driver to have their hands on the wheel as the car drives itself in case the person is needed to take over. Also Toyota has helped set the templet for Google\\'s smart car by producing the Toyota Prius. The knowledge of how to design a smart car has been around for a long time, but the technology is just now letting us build our dream car. Improvments on technology and cheaper technology makes it easier to build a smart car. An example of technology that has under gone this transformation are all the different sensors in cars. This technology is also making cars safe like an antilock break. People have long dreamed of driverless cars, and the human race is known for making dreams into realality. For a long time driverless cars have only been seen in television shows and movies, but now big name companies are working hard to solve the probelms that face smart cars to make it come true. This dream is nothing new, and was first tested in 1950s by GM. Driverless cars are not to far away in the future and will help make our lives safer. With some of the best companies in the world investing time, money, and reseach on smart cars the only question is when.

Every popular vote of the people should be counted towards deciding the next president. If America is a democracy and in a democracy people pick the leader then every citizen\\'s vote should count, not just the majority. First things first, only a few states have taken action towards my claim. Those being Maine and Nebraska. These states have made a \"proportional representation\", which is unlike the \"winner take all\" that the other 48 states have adopted. The text states \"Most states have a winner take all method system that awards all electors to the winning presidential candidate\" (What Is the Electoral College?7).This portrays that with the \"winner take all\" method various amounts of U.S. citizen votes have gone unaccounted for. Multiple occasions have dimmed the surface of our elections where their voices aren\\'t heard. The author says \"faithless electors have occasionally refused to vote for their party\\'s candidate and cast a deciding vote for whomever they please\" (Plumer 11). Going into this further, that means that one person can disagree with hundreds of people\\'s votes for his own vote of the opposite party. Also, if a tie was to occur int the total electoral votes then the outcome would be put into the hands of the House of Representitives. If the people were to vote in the first place this occurance would have never came close. On the other hand, it is much harder to calculate the total number of the\\xa0 popular vote being that there are millions of people voting. It is much easier to count and not dispute over a hundred or so votes than a million. But, having people know that their vote doesn\\'t make it to actually voting for the president makes them not as ethuisiastic about voting. The text says \"no voter\\'s vote swings an election\"(Posner 23). This explains why only about one half of eligible American voters voted. In conclusion, America is a democracy, which means people elect the president, not a elector but the people. The author states \"The electoral college is unfair, outdated, and irrational.\" (Plumer 14). This further explains that electors cannot make decisions without being biased toward their party.

The information your teacher discussed in class left as soon as the last bell rang in June, so you're also clueless. You might shrug it off until the last moment or just not do it at all. To avoid this dilemma, schools that require students to complete Summer assignments should give students the freedom to design the project themselves. If students are truly passionate about their work, they would be more likely to complete the assignment. This way students maintain the information they obtained in class and have an outlet to express their creative side. This may also benefit students who cannot learn in a classroom setting due to severe anxiety or other mental illnesses and are confused for the next year. It can be hard reteaching yourself something but not if you put your heart into it and design a project to fit your academic needs. Teacher's may argue that students will choose an easier route and not challenge themselves. They will also argue they worry that the students wont be creative. To avoid this teachers should create a rubric that the students must follow. This allows the teacher to grade the project on effort, creativity and neatness but also allowing the student to do what they please with the assignment. They may also fear that students might be inappropriate with their designs. However, teachers can discipline\\xa0them\\xa0by reporting them or writing them up.

Election by popular vote can really show what president the people really want, not the slate of electors who pick and choose what benefits them most. The system is corrupted and the popular vote is crucial in progressing as a united nation. The problems grow as we continue to use this outdated and irrational system. The voters simply can\\'t control who the electors vote for, making it outdated and irrational. States that have the most population get the most attention when it comes to presidential campaigns. The smaller states get none of the attention. How will they know who to vote for? It makes the people feel as if their vote is worthless. This just proves that the system is irrational and corrupted. As stated in source three, \"The most thoughtful voters should be the ones to decide the election\". This is not true, swing states are the cause of people feeling disenfranchised. The campaigners focus their efforts in the swing states where voters will listen more closely, not in states where there is less people like that.

Seeking answers from multiple people will give you more of an understanding about what is going on and what you should decide to do in order to produce a better outcome for you and for others. In order to make the right decision you need to be aware of how the majority of the people you ask view the topic. Asking questions about problems is how you become smarter. If nobody were to ask questions, nobody would be smart, and we would all still be living in caves. In order to gain knowledge we need to understand how things function in our world. We need to know what to do and what not to do. There are many possible outcomes that could lead to bad things if you don\\'t ask others\\' point of view on the topic. For example, a classmate named Generic_Name and I are having problems between ourselves. I do not know whether to apologize or to let the freindship die off. I ask ten people in my class about their opinion on Generic_Name. Nine out of the ten people think that Generic_Name has a very self loathing and snippy personality. They also say that he often does not care about his friends and only does things that please himself. Because I asked my fellow classmates, I now have a sense of Generic_Name\\'s personality traits. The majority of my classmates did not like Generic_Name very much. Mrs. Generic_Name, my math teacher, often gets mad at Generic_Name and sends him home with misbehavior notes for his parents to read. I now know that Generic_Name is not a very nice person and is prone to getting into trouble. Based on what I have heard from others and what I have learned in class about Generic_Name, I have come to the conclusion that it would not be a wise decision to become friends with Generic_Name again. Becoming friends with Generic_Name would set me up for failure. I would fall under the influence of Generic_Name and most likely get myself into trouble. Asking multiple people\\'s opinions can also be a great stradegy for the work environment. Getting advice from others at work can lead to multiple benefits. For example, I am working on a presentation for a new product, I ask my bosses whether or not they think it would be a good idea to implement a free fifty day trial. Eighty percent of my bosses deem it necessary to include a free fifty day trial. In the longrun, it would help push the customers to buy our product becuase they know they can always return it before the fifty days is up. As a result, on the day that the product was released to the public, we made thirty percent more sales than we had previously thought due to the fifty day free trial. That very same day my boss decided to give me a fifteen percent pay raise for my idea of implementing the fifty day free trial. In conclusion, you will always arrive at the best decision if you ask multiple people\\'s opinions. The best way to understand how the world works is to ask questions. Without questions we would still be living in caves with no electricity and wearing no clothes. \"Two heads are always better than one\", said the great Albert Einstein.

While I understand the rationale behind this move - to enhance scholarly pursuits by creating an incentive for students to improve their grades - I cannot fully support it due to several compelling considerations from both perspectives of fairness and effectiveness.\\n\\nAs an involved student-athlete, I witness firsthand instances where academically talented individuals, despite possessing impressive GPAs, struggle alongside peers whose grades trail behind yet display extraordinary athletic prowess. This situation underscores the intrinsic value of each domain of learning (academics and athletics) and raises concerns regarding whether conflating these spheres into a sole determinant of eligibility could potentially marginalize certain groups of deserving students. Furthermore, as an empathetic observer, I sympathize with those students whose academic endeavors face challenges owing to factors beyond their control. Implementation of such a rule would risk jeopardizing opportunities for otherwise thriving participants who exhibit potential within or beyond the realm of competition.\\n\\nAdditionally, although boosting academic performance through increased motivation may represent a beneficial outcome, I question whether simplifying the requirements could diminish the educational experience overall.

Engaging in self-directed tasks allows them to explore various fields of interest, such as conducting experiments or learning about a historical figure, thus providing ample opportunities for originality and excitement. Second, personalized projects foster enjoyment and reduce stress during the vacation period. Unlike a predetermined assignment from a teacher, designing individual projects enables flexibility and eliminates monotony, leading to increased motivation and enthusiasm among students.

Permit me to express my strong opposition towards confiscation of devices altogether, as such an extreme measure may instigate discontent amongst students, potentially leading to considerable distress rather than resolution. Instead, allowing limited access during breaks and non-instructional hours while ensuring compliance with educational requirements presents a reasonable compromise. Below, I elaborate upon several compelling arguments supporting this recommendation.\\nFirstly, connecting and communicating with peers is vital to adolescents. Modern technology facilitates constant interactions that contribute significantly to personal growth and emotional wellbeing. Consequently, restricting access to mobile communication tools disrupts essential aspects of social development. More importantly, establishing boundaries between academic settings and personal life outside the classroom allows for better focus, improved learning experiences, and overall mental balance.\\nAdditionally, it is crucial to acknowledge the importance of mitigating stressors within an increasingly demanding scholastic atmosphere. Students face significant pressure due to heavy workloads and mounting expectations. Cellphones serve as valuable coping mechanisms for alleviating anxiety and providing relief from daily challenges. In fact, humor shared via texts or calls often acts as an effective stress remedy.

       " '\\n\\nParaphrased version: Principal Sir, I firmly believe every student ought to participate in community service activities. This conviction stems from my belief in its inherent benefits. For instance, assisting young children, particularly those struggling with math lessons, can significantly impact their academic progress. Their parents might lack adequate educational backgrounds themselves, hence their inability to extend meaningful assistance. In such cases, community service plays an integral role by providing much-needed aid. Furthermore, lending a hand to the elderly population is equally rewarding. Tasks as simple as carrying groceries or tending to their gardens greatly ease their burden. Many seniors face adversity performing daily chores due to physical weaknesses; community service steps in during these moments of necessity. Additionally, maintaining environmental hygiene through litter pickup not only contributes to the preservation of our planet but also rescues countless wildlife lives from unfortunate demises caused by human negligence. College admission committees favor applicants with documented community service records due to demonstrating compassion towards society. Building friendships beyond scholastic circles and personal development represent further advantages of volunteering. Moreover, engaging in occasional outdoor labor presents a refreshing contrast to the monotony of indoor confinement, enhancing overall wellbeing. Therefore, I propose making community service mandatory to reap numerous social, moral, and psychological gains.',\n",
       " '.\\n\\nAn alternative version could read as follows:\\nPrincipal Sir, I am writing to voice my thoughts regarding the prospective implementation of mandatory community service for pupils at our school. I shall first share my perspective on community service before discussing the potential merits and demerits of enforcing it upon students. Acts of kindness towards the wider community bring immense joy to those receiving aid as well as to volunteers themselves. The self-satisfaction derived from giving back to society creates a sense of achievement, while cultivating empathy and compassion. However, compelling individuals to perform community service may yield unfavorable consequences. Resentment and reluctance amongst students might ensue, diminishing their willingness to put forth maximum effort and genuine emotional engagement. Instead of mandating participation, consider inspiring and encouraging pupils to engage voluntarily through positive reinforcement, peer influence, and incentives. This approach fosters enthusiasm for serving others, maximizing individual growth and societal impact. While fewer numbers may participate under an optional system, those choosing to serve wholeheartedly reap substantial benefits for themselves and the communities they assist. Thus, instilling a culture of altruism within our educational framework engenders lifelong habits of generosity and global awareness. Regards sincerely, A concerned pupil.',\n",
       " \"\\nTo Whom It May Concern, Many individuals derive satisfaction from assisting others within their community, engaging in such activities whenever feasible. This assistance may assume various forms, including volunteering at soup kitchens, monetary contributions, picking up trash, helping a neighbor load grocercies, among numerous possibilities. The act of contributing to one's community in this manner holds immense value, yet the term 'volunteering' precisely denotes its nature - it represents a deliberate decision to relinquish personal time for the benefit of others. Coercion undermines the spirit of volunteerism; hence, compelling individuals into community service eradicates its essence. Students, particularly those juggling academic responsibilities and employment, may lack the means to engage in voluntary services due to the demands placed upon them.

By preventing the occurrence of an election where no single candidate obtains a majority, this age-old system guarantees the valid selection of our country’s highest officeholder. The importance of electing a legitimate president cannot be overstated. Institutionalized through the US Constitution, the Electoral College emerged as a compromise between congressional voting and citizen balloting for the presidency. This pivotal institution has served critical functions within our democratic framework since its conception – particularly with respect to maintaining orderly transitions of power. Moreover, individuals whose influence hinges upon selecting the Commander-in-Chief recognize the significance of the Electoral College mechanism. A close examination of history reveals the potential for disastrous outcomes when the margin of victory is determined by relatively insignificant voter blocs; the 1976 election stands as a prime example, where merely 5,559 Ohioans and 3,687 Hawaiians casting their votes differently might have derailed the entire process.

       "' techonology called the ficial Action coding System enavles computer to identify human emotions is really good thing. we would like to know If they are lying about their emotional. Dr. Huang is really smart but I think he is right. First,computer to identify human emotions is really good thing because we would know If they are lying to us or no. Acoording the text \" can we actually \"calculate\"emotions like math homework\",I think they got the right point because our emotional is like calculate. They have to calculate are we really sad or happy. Another example from the text\" The Mona lisa demonstration is really intended to bring a smile to your face, while it shows just how much this computer can do\". I Hope our school should do like that so people we could help other people whenever we are sad. Second,these day a lot of people they are lying to another people to much. Honestly, I used to cheat on my girlfriend too back in the day but the good part is that we don\\'t know facial action yet. If we both know that time I bet she will say\" let do this because I want If you are cheating on me\". Still right now she don\\'t know that I cheat on her but we are already broke tho. I saw on social media a lot Boyfriend and girlfriend did that. When they know they both got cheating,both of them feel wierd. People is really good at hide thing I hope we are did Facial Action so we could know how is lying or nah. Finally,I think Dr huang is really smart doing those kind of thing.\" The software is the latest innovation from prof,Thomas Huang if the Beckman Institute for Advanced Science at the University OF lllinois.\"Some day I want be like him,He is my idol from now. Also If someone ask me who would I want to meet right now,I would say\" I want to meet with Dr. Huang\". Conclusion,every year different technology is coming out,I can\\'t Imagine what is going be like in 20 year later. What kind of technology would be going out.'"

       "' Maybe one day,we could detect emotion without asking question and then maybe technology like Facial Action Coding system is gonna make people more honest or less honest depending on the situation. And it\\'s important to remember that this technology is not perfect and can sometimes give false positives. But overall it\\'s an exciting development that has the potential to change the way we interact with each other. Here\\'s a paraphrased version of the text up to the same length: The Formal Action Coding System, a groundbreaking technological development by Prof. Thomas Huang at the Beckman Institute of the University of Illinois, enables computers to decipher human emotions. This capability holds great significance as it permits determining if individuals are being truthful about their feelings. According to the statement \"can we mathematically quantify emotions like solving algebraic problems?\" the authors raise valid points. Emotion recognition entails evaluating whether one is genuinely joyous or dejected. An illustrative instance from the text states, \"The Mona Lisa demonstration aims to elicit a grin from viewers, revealing the extent of this computer\\'s prowess,\" underscoring its utility in enhancing empathy and assisting others during tough times. Nowadays, deceitfulness among people is rampant. Reflecting upon past experiences, such as dishonesty in relationships, I acknowledge the potential benefits of this innovation.

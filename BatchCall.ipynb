In essay form, explain if drivers should or should not be able to use cell phones in any capacity while operating a vehicle.': [\" Do you think there should be stricter laws regarding texting or talking on the phone while driving?\\n\\nDrivers Should Not Be Able to Use Cell Phones While Operating a Vehicle\\n\\nTechnology has greatly improved the way humans interact and communicate with each other. Unfortunately, technology has also posed a significant risk and danger to human beings, especially when it comes to driving. As a result, drivers should not be able to use cell phones in any capacity while operating a vehicle due to the potential harm and danger it can bring to the driver and other road users.\\n\\nDistracted Driving\\n\\nOne reason drivers should not use cell phones while driving is that it distracts them from the primary task of driving. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) identified three main types of distraction: visual, manual, and cognitive. Visual distraction refers to taking one's eyes off the road, manual distraction involves taking one's hands off the steering wheel, and cognitive distraction pertains to taking one's mind off driving.\\n\\nDriving a vehicle requires complete focus on the road, the vehicle, and the other users. When a driver's attention is divided, the chance of getting into a car accident increases significantly. Drivers who are using their cell phones while driving are three times more likely to get into a car accident than those who are not using their cell phones. In\",\n",
       "  ' Provide reasons and examples to support your answer.\\n\\nDrivers Should Not Be Able to Use Cell Phones in Any Capacity While Operating a Vehicle\\n\\nThe increased use of cell phones while driving has become a dangerous epidemic in modern society. People who use cell phones while operating a vehicle often become distracted from the road, leading to accidents and fatalities. In order to make the roads safer for all users, drivers should not be able to use cell phones in any capacity while operating a vehicle.\\n\\nOne reason that drivers should not be able to use cell phones in any capacity while operating a vehicle is that cell phone use significantly increases the likelihood of an accident occurring. According to a study conducted by the Virginia Tech Transportation Institute, texting while driving increases the risk of an accident by 23 times (Boyle, 2013). This is due to the fact that texting while driving takes the driver’s attention away from the road for an average of 4.6 seconds, which is enough time to travel the length of a football field at 55 miles per hour (Boyle, 2013). Additionally, a study conducted by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration found that drivers who were using cell phones were four times more likely to be involved in a crash that required hospitalization (Boyle, 2013).\\n\\nAnother reason that drivers should not be able to use cell'],\n",

Your essay must be based on ideas and information that can be found in the passage set.

Be sure to use evidence from multiple sources; and avoid overly relying on one source. Your response should be in the form of a multiparagraph essay. Write your essay in the space provided.': ['\\n\\nTitle: Advantages of Limiting Car Usage\\n\\nEvery day millions of people around the world use cars to travel from one place to another. In fact, the use of cars as the primary mode of transportation has significantly contributed to the increasing economic growth and social welfare of many societies. However, excessive use of cars is not without its challenges. According to recent studies, a substantial amount of air pollution is caused by cars. Furthermore, the increasing dependence on cars contributes to the growing health problems among citizens. Therefore, limiting car usage can bring about numerous advantages for society.\\n\\nFirst, limiting car usage can help reduce the level of air pollution in many cities. According to the article, Cars Contribute to Half of All Air Pollution, \"cars are responsible for producing 50% of the air pollution in the world\" (Smith 23). As cars release harmful gases into the atmosphere, the air quality in the surrounding areas becomes poor. This situation often results in the creation of smog, which can lead to health problems such as respiratory difficulties and allergies. Furthermore, air pollution can also have a damaging effect on the environment. The article states, \"air pollution destroys the earth\\'s ozone layer and contributes to global warming\" (Smith 24). As a result, the excessive use of cars can not only have an adverse impact on public health but also harm the environment.\\n',\n",
       "  '\\n\\nLimiting car usage has several advantages to both individuals and society. According to a study conducted by the University of California, Berkeley, cars are responsible for nearly a third of the greenhouse gases that cause global warming. This is because cars emit large amounts of carbon dioxide, a harmful greenhouse gas, when they burn fuel. Reducing the number of cars on the road can significantly decrease the amount of carbon dioxide that is released into the atmosphere, which can help slow down global warming.\\n\\nIn addition to reducing greenhouse gases, limiting car usage can also improve air quality. According to a report by the Environmental Protection Agency, cars are the largest source of air pollution in the United States. Cars emit harmful pollutants such as nitrogen oxides, particulate matter, and volatile organic compounds, which can cause respiratory problems and other health issues. By reducing the number of cars on the road, we can significantly improve the air quality in our communities, making it healthier for everyone.\\n\\nAnother advantage of limiting car usage is that it can reduce traffic congestion. According to a study by the Texas A&M Transportation Institute, the average American driver spends over 40 hours a year stuck in traffic. This not only wastes time and fuel, but it also contributes to stress and anxiety. By reducing the number of cars on the road, we can alleviate traffic congest'],\n",
       " 'Imagine that you are a high school student. Some schools require students to complete summer projects to assure they continue learning during their break. Should these summer projects be teacher-designed or student-designed? Take a position on this question. Support your response with reasons and specific examples.': ['\\n\\nAs a high school student, I believe that summer projects should be student-designed rather than teacher-designed. Giving students the freedom to choose and design their own projects promotes ownership, engagement, and creativity while also providing valuable real-world skills.\\n\\nFirst, when students design their own projects, they take ownership of their learning. They become active participants in the educational process, rather than passive recipients of knowledge. For example, a student interested in environmental science might choose to design a project that involves monitoring local water quality and presenting their findings to the community. This level of investment in their learning will lead to a deeper understanding of the subject matter and a greater sense of accomplishment.\\n\\nSecond, student-designed projects foster engagement and motivation. When students have the autonomy to choose a topic that aligns with their passions and interests, they are more likely to be engaged in the learning process. This engagement can lead to a deeper level of understanding and a more meaningful educational experience. For instance, a student who loves photography might design a project that involves documenting local wildlife and sharing their images with the school community. This project would not only allow the student to hone their photography skills but also encourage them to explore the natural world around them.\\n\\nThird, student-designed projects promote creativity and innovation.

This approach offers several benefits to students, including promoting creativity, fostering ownership and accountability, and allowing students to explore their interests.\\n\\nFirstly, student-designed projects provide an opportunity for students to exercise their creativity and critical thinking skills. Students can choose a topic that interests them, research it, and present their findings in a format that suits their strengths and interests. For example, a student interested in photography might create a photo essay, while another interested in writing could write a research paper. This approach allows students to explore their passions, which leads to more engaging and meaningful learning experiences.\\n\\nSecondly, student-designed projects foster a sense of ownership and accountability. When students are involved in the design process, they are more invested in the outcome. They take ownership of their learning and are more likely to put in the effort required to complete the project successfully. Additionally, student-designed projects allow for more authentic assessment. Teachers can evaluate students based on their ability to set goals, plan, and execute a project rather than simply regurgitating information.\\n\\nFinally, student-designed projects allow students to explore their interests and develop new skills. Teachers may not be familiar with every subject area, and their projects may not align with students' interests. By allowing students to design their projects, they can explore\"],\n",

For instance, if a student is trying to decide whether to take a gap year, talking to several people who have done so can help them understand the potential drawbacks, such as the difficulty of readjusting to academic life after a year away.\\n\\nFinally, seeking multiple opinions can help us build a support network and feel more confident in our decision. When we know that we have the backing of several people, we are more likely to feel confident and secure in our choices. For example, if a student is trying to decide whether to pursue']}"

    "txt = \"\\n\\nCell phones have become a necessity in today's fast-paced world. However, their use while driving has become a topic of debate due to the numerous accidents caused by distracted driving. While some argue that drivers should be allowed to use cell phones in certain capacities, others believe that their use while driving should be completely prohibited. In my opinion, drivers should not be able to use cell phones in any capacity while operating a vehicle.\\n\\nFirstly, using a cell phone while driving is a significant distraction that can lead to accidents. According to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, distracted driving claimed 3,142 lives in 2019. Cell phone use while driving is a form of distracted driving that takes the driver's attention away from the road, increasing the risk of accidents.\\n\\nSecondly, using a cell phone while driving impairs the driver's ability to react to changing road conditions. Studies have shown that drivers who use cell phones while driving have slower reaction times, making it difficult for them to avoid accidents. Moreover, using a cell phone while driving can also lead to tunnel vision, where the driver's peripheral vision is compromised, making it difficult to see other vehicles, pedestrians, or obstacles on the road.\\n\\nThirdly, using a hands-free device while driving is not a safe alternative. While some argue that hands-free devices are safer than hand\""

However, their use while driving has become a topic of debate due to the numerous accidents caused by distracted driving. While some argue that drivers should be allowed to use cell phones in certain capacities, others believe that their use while driving should be completely prohibited. In my opinion, drivers should not be able to use cell phones in any capacity while operating a vehicle. Firstly, using a cell phone while driving is a significant distraction that can lead to accidents. According to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, distracted driving claimed 3,142 lives in 2019. Cell phone use while driving is a form of distracted driving that takes the driver's attention away from the road, increasing the risk of accidents. Secondly, using a cell phone while driving impairs the driver's ability to react to changing road conditions. Studies have shown that drivers who use cell phones while driving have slower reaction times, making it difficult for them to avoid accidents. Moreover, using a cell phone while driving can also lead to tunnel vision, where the driver's peripheral vision is compromised, making it difficult to see other vehicles, pedestrians, or obstacles on the road.

    "txt = \"Cell phones have become a necessity in today's fast-paced world. However, their use while driving has become a topic of debate due to the numerous accidents caused by distracted driving. While some argue that drivers should be allowed to use cell phones in certain capacities, others believe that their use while driving should be completely prohibited. In my opinion, drivers should not be able to use cell phones in any capacity while operating a vehicle. Firstly, using a cell phone while driving is a significant distraction that can lead to accidents. According to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, distracted driving claimed 3,142 lives in 2019. Cell phone use while driving is a form of distracted driving that takes the driver's attention away from the road, increasing the risk of accidents. Secondly, using a cell phone while driving impairs the driver's ability to react to changing road conditions. Studies have shown that drivers who use cell phones while driving have slower reaction times, making it difficult for them to avoid accidents. Moreover, using a cell phone while driving can also lead to tunnel vision, where the driver's peripheral vision is compromised, making it difficult to see other vehicles, pedestrians, or obstacles on the road. Thirdly, using a hands-free device while driving is not a safe alternative. While some argue that hands-free devices are safer than hand\"\n",
